But open source scientific article journals, and diligent use of multiple search engines to uncover multiple viewpoints is way way better than reading thirteen Wikipedia pages on, say, Egyptian history and then pretend you know any great deal of the subject.")

('Right', "Improved this again after my previous post was banned for interacting with other subs. We do have a subreddit called Children of Dusk, if you want to check out more of this world, google it.\n\nLore Sample:\n\nEconomic Collapse, 2 World Wars, 2 Religious Revolutions, the Rise of the Global South, and the establishment of an extremely multipolar world order.\n\nEach individual region has mountains of lore, just for an example. Fatalist Germany is a country controlled by a superintelligent AI, but it's hardware has been degrading over time, and it's superiority over humans has been shrinking as artificial intelligence turned out to hit a wall of diminishing returns, and humanity has now built other technology that can counter it. By the year 2100, what used to be the haunting specter of the world has been reduced to a rump state, increasingly reliant on their allies in a Technocratic France to support itself.\n\nIn the East African Federation, a council of benevolent corporations took power, stepping in after the failure of their governments in the floods and nuclear winter of World War 4, radically restructuring society around the corporation. Originally exploiting the economy for profit, these CEOs have now drunk their own propaganda so much that they genuinely do believe they are a series of benevolent despots, leading the world to a new world order. Think of every what every modern corporation tries to present, thinking they're going to save the world, but now they believe that unironically.\n\nSurveillance cameras dot every street, and familial relationships are banned, because the company is your family, everyone is your family, and you wouldn't want to let your family down, would you? In the Islamic World, the failure of the 3rd Arab-Israeli War sparked a radical shift in the culture of Islam, people became convinced that Islam had fallen behind, and only by modernizing can the religion compete with its older brother, Christianity, which by now was going through a reawakening. The Islamic Culture Wars saw the conflict between Islamic modernity and traditionalists wage out, with new movements like Quranism taking over Turkey.\n\nIn America, an economic crash, and rising polarization saw a confrontation between the center-left and the far right (In America center-left is far left honestly.) leading to the victory of Victoria Cortez, a Christian nationalist who radically restructured the nation in her image in preparation for a fight against the Eurasians and Chinese, who at the time controlled the world. The eventual confrontation led to billions of deaths, and 15% of America's population specifically being wiped out. With the ash clearing, did the American eagle finally begin to recover. Under the progressive administration of Alisha Crowder, and later on, Julia Land, the US eventually transitioned back into a semi-liberal democracy, though marks of its Christian Nationalist era remains.\n\nIt is worth noting here that Alisha Crowder later greatly radicalized later in life, moving to Cuba, joining the Solarpunk movement, and then becoming the first ex-American president to assassinate another ex-American president, ironically she assassinated Julia Land, the first Asian president of the US. This has very little to do with everything else I just wanted to mention it this timeline is insane.\n\nFinally, in the year 2092, Bernie Sanders, beyond all odds somehow takes the presidency, now being over 100 years old. After being in office for precisely 23 days, he passes free healthcare, then has a stroke and dies on the Resolute Table right after he signed it into law, his life purpose being complete.\n\nIf you really want to see the sheer autism of this timeline there's a full Google doc here. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9ELHr5oiN2XjczQfhiljoGPQxCFgHGR1AnLlokJoEs/edit?usp=sharing\n\nIf you have any further questions about the lore, reply to this post and I'll answer any questions you may have.")

Also it seems like I just began to write a wall of text to explain the libleft position on those 3 words so I guess the meme was accurate with all its imperfection because the meme ask a definition of the political value with only one  word that could mean basicaly anything depending of the interpretation we make. The fact is that the libleft inpretation of those words is more true and more useful that the one each other quadrant use. the concept of liberty for exemple in the libright interpretation, would be more accurately described as the dictatorship of the capital because the liberty they defend is based on the value of the property each person possesses, as such the interest of those who own nothing would not be respected and only those who can use their capital will rightfully influence the way society work in this paradigm, thus the level of liberty each person enjoy would vary according to their relative wealth so tbe less wealthy would not have the same liberty that the rich would enjoy. liberty without equality is the tyrany of the powerful. Secondly the order autright defend is, in fact, chaos. The autright claim that their subjective perspective of what normality should be the eternal order and they never acknoledge that their idea doesnt correspond to reality and thus the "order" they create always have to fight against the reality that the world doesnt comply with the delusion they live in,  because of the idea that they protect   their order against the true order in which every progressive movement strive toward, they create and entertain the dialectical struggle between reality and the illusion of a pure tradition, creating chaos, a struggle between the old and the new and a war between reality and the narative that keep them in power. A true order would be to accept and evolve with the world and its diversity rather than to fight for the violent dominion of one\'s subjective archetype over the other. In fact, Anarchy is order! damn I\'m tired please for the rest imagined that I continue my rant by explaining how equality need freedom to be useful and that equality alone without taking needs into account contradictory and that only free and equal access to the means and the fruits of production is can bring a more healthy type of equality. to conclude not only is liberty, order and equality not contradictory they have to evolve in unity with one another to realy bring the best of each concept and the libleft position is the only that acknowledge and impleament them as such. The Autright oppose Progress with Order and only create Chaos. The Libright oppose Equality with Liberty and Autleft oppose Liberty with Equality and both can only create Tyrany. Only with libleft   can Liberty and Equality, Anarchy and communism, colaborate and thrive, and bring true Order by evolving with the world instead of opposing it.')

('Left', 'Im actually somewhat of an expert on this particular issue. You see, by chance of my birth, i have always had access to the highest quality dairy products. My hometown had a local tourist spot that was just a place to buy milk. But it was no ordinary milk, it was world renowned milk. And naturally that translated into world renowned ice cream. 2 scoops of that ice cream and you were in a 6 hour food coma GAUREN-FUCKING-TEED or your money back. Big chain stores get on their knees and suck dick just to get a chance at a phone call with the owners of the dairy store and possibly secure a single shipment for them to sell. \n\nBut like all kids, eventually it was time for me to make my own way, so i set off to college, leaving a tear behind for the drop in dairy quality I anticipated.\n\nCome to find out my university was founded for agriculture and, within campus limits, sold non-fda approved dairy. Librights, hear me now: the fda does NOT want you to know just how good ice cream can be. When you go past the theoretical fda limits on fat content, well lets just say there was no downgrade in dairy quality in my life. That 6 hour food coma turned to an 8 hour food coma. I could barely make the walk back to my dorm before the nap kicked in. \n\nSo yes, im a dairy expert. I could never consume peasant dairy available at normal stores. Fighting over store ice cream is what the ruling class wants. They want you to think thats what ice cream is, and they dont want you to know what ice cream can be.')

They do get a few electoral votes, at least.\n\nNow, if you think teenagers should be able to vote, or shouldn\'t have to pay taxes, that\'s fine to argue, but it\'s a separate issue from "taxation without representation".')

('Centrist', 'I\'m just going to copy and past my comment from when I fist saw this hitting youtube:\n_____\n\nOkay, if I\'m taking a 100% objective look at this, these are (for the most part) genuinely interesting character concepts and designs.... If (and only if) they get written well. (Good luck writers.) (Also, I guess I should point out that I\'m not familiar with the old New Warriors, so I don\'t know how much, or if at all, these new ones clash with the old ones.)\n\nLike, a character who can create protective barriers, but only when protecting is actually a pretty cool idea for a power. That one specifically reminds me of Josuke Higashikata\'s Crazy Diamond, who can heal/repair anything, with the only exception being himself.  Similarly, a character with the entire internet to draw knowledge from seems just as interesting. My only issues power-wise is that beyond a VERY basic description, we have no idea what "Snowflake" does, "B-Negative" seems to really just be lazily phoning in a discount Morbius, and we get NO description of what "Trailblazer" even does.\n\nFrom a design perspective, I actually only really have issue with wannabe Morbius, because that\'s the one where I literally can not think of a time period where that would be seen as a good design, even for a 90\'s anti-hero. I normally I\'d take issue with "Trailblazer\'s" size, just because I\'m not a fan of fat characters in general. However, I then remembered that I hated My Hero Acedemia\'s Fat Gum initially because of his size and name, and I thought about how I actually do like the character now that I\'ve gotten a bit used to him and his power set. So yeah, assuming her power doesn\'t contradict her size, I don\'t really have an issue with her design. As for the rest, I don\'t particularly love any of the designs, but I do find them to be passable. I guess I could complain about how yet another "non-binary" character is drawn as just a short-haired chick, but that\'s such a common practice that I don\'t  really give a shit anymore.\n\nNow when it comes to the names, I\'ve seen some people in the comments talk about how generic "Screentime, Trailblazer, and B-Negative" are, but honestly, I can\'t really pin that on the writers. It\'s been 80 years since Superhero comics first came into existance, and at this point, all of the good, and even most of the bad, names have been taken. As for "Snowflake" and "Safe Space," if I ignore the obvious political stance they\'re meant to convey, I actually don\'t hate the names. We don\'t know exactly what "Snowflake\'s" power is, but we can presume something ice-based from it. As for "Safe Space",  his is actually very fitting for his powerset, and assumidly fits his personality as well. (You know, in a protective brother, not fragile SJW way.)\n\nAs to some of the nitpicky things I\'ve noticed in the comments: Yeah, "Safe Space" and "Snowflake" seem to have a pretty "close" and creepy bond for brother and sister, but then again it can\'t be any worse than 90\'s Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Also, yes, "Internet Gas" does sound stupid as hell, but no more stupid than some of the other ways people have gained powers in the comic-book worlds.\n\nAs a final note, we\'ve been telling SJWs for years now that if they want to have "inclusive" superheros, then they should make them themselves, rather than trying to convert old characters. In this case, that\'s exactly what they did, and I feel like we should support them for it. At the very least it\'s being written by Daniel Kibblesmith, who also wrote Loki (2019), and Black Panther VS Deadpool, so we do know that it\'s at least being written by a competent writer.\n\nEDIT Before Pressing Send:\n\nOkay, so I read the official post, and I was right, "Snowflake\'s" powers are ice based. Specifically, she throws snowflake-shaped ice shurikens. On the other hand, "Trailblazer" has the power of an infinite-pocket-dimension backpack where she can reach in and grab an item, but it\'s at random and not in her control. So yeah, design\'s kinda neutral on that one, and the name\'s not fitting. I would have gone with "Backpacker" if they\'re trying to give a hiking theme\nhttps://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/introducing-the-new-new-warriors\n\n____\n\nEDIT: /r/dontrespondjustdownvote')

It\'s not just a quaint little story like some episode of a kids show that teaches a nice moral lesson and is forgotten about. (Although there are some TV shows of higher quality, I really feel like Thomas the Tank Engine did a good job of showing many aspects of the human condition and I was reminded of this whole watching Bullet Train recently, no spoilers but if you\'ve seen it you know).\n\nTangent aside the reason this story has held up is because it conveys an important message. That message is that something may very well be a bad thing that poses a threat but if you claim everything is that threat eventually people get annoyed and stop listening, then one day it actually shows up but it\'s too late because nobody takes you seriously anymore.\n\nLooking back in history seriously it is clear to me that the view that sees history as ever marching forward to the progressive viewpoint, held back by bigots for a time but always marching forward, is not true. There have been radical and sudden cultural shifts toward culturally liberal values like we see today in the west but there has also been the opposite, look at the Middle East in the 60s to early 70s versus the four decades after that. I\'d argue that the Middle East is moving from religious fanaticism to a culturally conservative but less radical strong man style politics but it shows that the march of progressive values often reverses.\n\nMy point is there really are some scary elements on the fringes of the right and I think the arc of history makes it clear we are due for a right-wing backlash largely due to the fact that I think a lot of the urban elite have way less power than they have but act like they have more than they do and there\'s a growing distrust of all the institutions they are concentrated in and their ideology needs institutional support to function since it\'s so out of touch with human nature and the real world that in a vacuum it would lose. The question is to what? Hopefully a sane conservatism, but it might not be.\n\nThat being said when the people who are the true bigots who can actually get things done show up they won\'t be dumb enough to carry a swastika flag. It won\'t be "literally Handmaid\'s Tale" overnight but like boiling a frog things will become more and more extreme. Yet nobody will listen when the strong man really shows up because they accused everyone of being that, when in truth it will be somebody way more savvy than DeSantis, and way, way more than Trump.\n\nA good recent point of this is the George Santos think, it\'s pretty clear that Santos lied about his resume at this point. But he made the ok gesture on the floor of the House and again returned to the claim that this was a white power symbol. So here you have somebody who deserves legitimate criticism but they undermine that by making claims like this.')

('Left', 'If you think medical school admissions have dick all to do with merit you have never been close to the system. \n\nAnd even with these statistics, black physicians make up less than 5% of total doctors despite being 13ish% of the population. \n\nThere are a million things you can critique medical school admissions for, this is near the bottom of the list. \n\nWant to actually make a difference? Drop the cost of admission substantially. The vast majority of med students (myself included) could not have supported ourselfs during admission. \n\nMy application cost around 8,000 dollars. Every school charges u a few hundred (probably 60ish% of applications will be automatically filtered before a human sees it, but only after you pay the cost). Then they send you a secondary app if you got the grades+mcat and charge u another 50-200 (again PER SCHOOL). Speaking of the mcat, thats another 300, unless you want to score well, then u need to pay 2000+ for a prep course. Then there are a bunch of bullshit personality tests that cost 150-250 that only an idiot would answer honestly on. Most schools required 1-2 of these, i paid for 2 (350 for my year). A conservative applicant (like myself) applied to 18 schools, but most neurotic premeds apply to 50+, more than doubling this cost. After all of this, assuming you have the grades, you still have only about a 40% chance of acceptance. Most applicants these days need a gap year, so if they applied and failed double the cost. Its not unreasonable to spend 20k getting into medical school, all while requiring us to have degrees that can only get u minimum wage jobs. How the fuck can someone without rich parents do that? \n\nThere is a point when you are qualified for medical school. Then theres the point where u can be accepted into medical school. Id estimate 75ish% of the applicant pool each year can handle the academic stress. 40% are admitted. \n\nWe are not accepting the best people who will be good doctors, we are selecting the most competitive humans alive and then expecting them to magically become extra good compassionate people after shoving them in a room to study for 12 hours a day every day for 2 years. Its almost like they optimized this process to kill every ounce of empathy a person is capable of.')

What Carlson is saying here hasn‚Äôt fully realized the issue however, he‚Äôs saying that these elites are accusing people of being racist in order to incite racial division. That just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. What I see is an elite class funding media that draws young white men deeper into racist conspiracies using dog whistles and innocent sounding but sinisterly motivated talking points. The alt right pipeline as it is often referred to by leftist leads vulnerable young men through a series of beliefs, often at their beginning accurate criticism of the modern world be it the problems of liberal democracy, or late stage capitalism, or dumb shit that radical feminists say. These base truths are then used to draw conclusions about culture, often that minority groups are asking for or being given more privileges then working class white people. This logic caries through painting an abrasive image of the left. Then through jokes and narrow statistics these young men are drawn closer into beliefs about groups and races of people, encouraging maybe not an outright racial hierarchy but certainly a belief that their are inherent differences between the races. Racialism. Over time though members are drawn closer and brought to believe in the outright separation of races or later into belief in the validity of an ethnostate. Conspiracy theories are circulated in alt right groups such as the great replacement. The modern American right consists of various levels of racialism and racism that are often on close communication. A conservative radio host might have as a guest a racialist book author, thus introducing his audience to those ideas further indoctrinating some of them. That same author might write about a facist figure such as Hitler, disavowing the uglier parts of his politics while justifying others. This means that some of his audience will be introduced to these ideas and some of those indoctrinated into a facist mindset. What‚Äôs generally at the center of the alt right are ideas like ‚Äúthe Jewish question‚Äù offering for example the idea that the Jews are behind conspiracies like the great replacement but also that they are the driving force behind the problems of late stage capitalism. My point is, the right either online or in media will often use true statements and a leap in logic to justify untrue conclusions. I see this here. Funny meme btw.')

The US was conceptualized to nearly all of Founders as being of a Christian stock, and it was John Adams who said the Constitution would serve a ‚Äúmoral and Christian people; it will serve no other‚Äù.\n\nIn practice this means that the Federal Government cannot create a state religion or suppress any faiths, but the people are encouraged to worship God nonetheless. The US was built upon a highly religious foundation, they were just wary about enforcing the States control of religion (as they should be) due to their experiences with the British monarchy and the oppression of non-Anglican Christianity. \n\nMany on the Right don‚Äôt like when Leftists try to use these principles to try and stomp out religion instead of what they were supposed to do: protect them from the government.

CA and GamersRiseUp were banned under this pathway, and PCM stands at a small-medium risk of being banned in this manner, but its not substantial\n\n2. Subreddit encourages real-world events that reddit does not want to be associated with. MDE, me_ira got banned under this pathway, CTH and T_D got quarantined under it. It is highly unlikely that PCM will be banned under such conditions\n\n3. The subreddit has large amounts of ironic jokes that when misconstrued can mean egregious reddit-wide rule violations. given that legoyoda got an instaban under such circumstances, and by nature was somewhat similar to PCM, I think that this is the highest risk that is posed to PCM.')

Herndon said the state of Idaho has nothing to do with forcing anyone to carry a child and those are merely natural circumstances.\n\n‚ÄúSome people could describe the situation that you‚Äôre talking about as the opportunity to have a child in those terrible circumstances if the rape actually occurred,‚Äù Herndon told Wintrow. He told the story of a person in Montana who wrote a book about how her stepfather raped her and forced her to have an abortion the first time she was pregnant and the second time she had the child.\n\n‚ÄúThat child that she actually had proved to be incredibly cathartic for her and a huge blessing in her life,‚Äù he said."\n\n\n\nSo a huge miss-characterisation of what he said. \n\nAdd on to that he was making an attempt to clear the grey lines for when an abortion is allowed under the current legislation:\n\n"The change would ensure health care professionals would not face prosecution or other legal consequences for handling certain common complications during pregnancy, Herndon said. It would clarify that the Legislature‚Äôs interest is in the living child,\xa0he said.\n\n‚ÄúI have run this by several in our medical community, this language has been reviewed by a number of pro-life physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists and they agree that this offers some clarity for them as to legitimate medical practice,‚Äù Herndon said...\n\nSen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, said the bill is a ‚Äúgreat solution to a real issue‚Äù and thanked Herndon for sponsoring it.\n\n‚ÄúI have doctors in our community that I know have expressed concern that they could be working to save the life of a mother and there could be an issue where they would feel like they were stuck between a rock and a hard place,‚Äù Toews said. ‚ÄúThis type of legislation is what we need to address that situation.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSo far from saying that incestual rape was cathartic he was referencing a case where a mother said having the baby was cathartic for her, her words, not his.\n\nAND he was trying to make it *easier for doctors to perform abortions in cases where it would be admissible*\n\nLeftists shooting themselves in the foot with this lazy propaganda.')

('Libertarian Right', 'The criticism of Reagan\'s handling of the USSR is a level of cope I rarely see. The USSR ended detente with their stupid idea to stabilize their communist allies in Afghanistan. You can\'t start wars and call for international disarmament at the same time.\n\nReagan didn\'t "create al-Queda", he gave weapons to the Mujahadeen who were resisting the Soviet invasion. The Mujahadeen was comprised of different groups from all over the world who later fought each other during the Afghan Civil War following the Soviet withdrawal. Osama bin Laden is the founder of AQ, and they were just one of the groups operating in Afghanistan after the war. \n\nGorbachev\'s request to get rid of Soviet nukes in exchange for America doing the same was made when the Soviets had zero leverage because of the impending collapse of the Soviet economy. By the time Gorbachev took power in 1985, 1 out of every 3 loaves of bread consumed in the USSR were imported. The problem for the Soviets was that the oil money they used to purchase foreign goods was gone by 1985. Why was it gone? Because the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan spooked the Saudis into aligning with the US and decreasing the price of oil. The goal of this collaboration was to choke the Soviet wallet and prevent the USSR from further aggression in the Muslim world. Facing a food crisis and no funds to import goods, Gorbachev needed to come to a deal with Reagan, and it was the Reagan administration that forced Gorbachev to grant political rights in the USSR. The offer to get rid of all nukes was just a publicity stunt that no one was interested in accepting. \n\nReagan wasn\'t perfect, but his handling of the USSR and using their own aggression against them was brilliant. The real second-worst president of the modern era was Barack Obama btw.')

Scott Herndon, R-Sagle, sought to change the state‚Äôs abortion laws, remove requirements for public works contractors to provide bathrooms that align with gender identity, and strengthen the state‚Äôs ‚ÄúStand Your Ground‚Äù laws; the one proposal of his that the Senate State Affairs Committee members did not vote to introduce would have removed rape and incest exemptions from Idaho‚Äôs abortion bans.\n\n\nSpeaking on Martin Luther King Jr. Day/Idaho Human Rights Day, Herndon equated his efforts to offer ‚Äúequal protection‚Äù under the law to fetuses to King‚Äôs civil rights efforts.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of auspicious that today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and he spent 13 years advancing the civil rights of people based on certain characteristics, and this does the same thing,‚Äù Herndon told the committee.\n\nMinority Leader Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, asked about situations in which teenage girls were raped by an uncle or father and if that girl would be forced to carry her pregnancy to term under Herndon‚Äôs proposed legislation.\n\nHerndon replied, ‚Äúsome people could describe the situation that you‚Äôre talking about as the opportunity to have the child under those terrible circumstances, if the rape actually occurred.‚Äù\n\nCurrently, the abortion ban includes an affirmative defense for abortions performed in cases of rape and incest if a police report is filed, but Herndon said that is merely an allegation that a rape or incest took place.\n\nThe committee voted to return the proposal to the senator rather than introducing it as a bill, with only Sen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, voting against it.\n\nSen. Treg Bernt, R-Meridian, told the Idaho Press he felt the proposed legislation went too far.\n\n‚ÄúThose exemptions are important and need to be respected under the law,‚Äù Bernt said.\n\nSens. Chuck Winder, R-Boise; Kelly Anthon, R-Burley; and Abby Lee, R-Fruitland, were absent.\n\nThe legislation Herndon did successfully introduce relating to abortion would add definitions of abortion and embryo or fetus. The proposal would amend the state‚Äôs trigger ban to say that embryo or fetus would, ‚Äúmean any human in utero‚Äù‚Äîwhich Herndon said would clarify that the criminal penalties for performing an abortion do not apply to treatment for an ectopic pregnancy, which is when the fetus develops outside of the uterus.\n\n\nThe bill would add the definition, ‚Äú‚ÄòAbortion‚Äô means the use or prescription of any instrument, medicine, drug, or other substance or device to intentionally kill a living embryo or fetus. ‚ÄòAbortion‚Äô shall not include the unintentional death of any human embryo or fetus.‚Äù\n\nHe said adding that the embryo or fetus is ‚Äúliving‚Äù and clarified that there would be no prosecution if an abortion was done when the fetus had miscarried.\n\nThe proposed bill adds that any person who provides care to a pregnant woman to save her life that results in the accidental death or injury to the fetus will not be prosecuted under the ban. Previously this only applied to healthcare professionals, but Herndon said he wanted to expand it to include all first responders.\n\nBernt said he would vote to introduce the legislation, ‚Äújust to do more research on it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI just need to learn more about it,‚Äù the freshman Senator told the Idaho Press. He said he‚Äôd want to reach out to healthcare professionals as he looked into this legislation and its potential effects.\n\nHerndon on Monday morning also brought forward legislation which, unless it‚Äôs required by federal law, states that public works contractors are not required to offer access to multiple-occupancy bathroom, changing room, or shower facilities to those whose gender identity is different from their biological sex.\n\nIn 2014, President Barack Obama signed an executive order banning federal contracts from discriminating on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. Herndon said that in projects in which federal funds are not used, the contracts do not have to include provisions that would allow people to use the bathrooms that align with their gender identity.\n\nWintrow asked Herndon, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm curious, how do we know somebody is transgender and how would we prohibit them from using a bathroom or shower facility?‚Äù\n\nHerndon said the bill only prohibits provisions in contracts and would not be determining if people are transgender.\n\nWintrow was the only committee member to vote against the introduction of the legislation.\n\n\nHerndon, in his fourth proposal of the day, sought to add to the state‚Äôs ‚ÄúStand Your Ground‚Äù laws, which allow for use of deadly force if someone is ‚Äúprotecting himself or his family by reasonable means necessary‚Äù and if they reasonably fear ‚Äúimminent peril of death or serious bodily injury,‚Äù the current law states.\n\nHerndon would like to add a section to the current statute that would allow for a pre-trial immunity hearing within 14 days if someone is arrested for use of force and they file a motion to dismiss on the basis of self-defense.\n\nTo overcome the immunity, prosecutors would have to prove ‚Äúby clear and convincing evidence,‚Äù which is an elevated standard of evidence.\n\nIf a case went to trial, and a jury found the defendant not guilty, there would be a separate question posed to the jury about whether the finding was based upon self-defense. If the jury answered yes, the judge could require the recovery of all of the defendant‚Äôs costs.\n\nWintrow voted to introduce the legislation but said she still had ‚Äúa lot of questions‚Äù about how it would affect law enforcement and court proceedings.\n\nThe legislation that was voted to be introduced will be assigned a bill number and then introduced by being read on the floor.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Idaho Press, read more on IdahoPress.com.')
