What Carlson is saying here hasn‚Äôt fully realized the issue however, he‚Äôs saying that these elites are accusing people of being racist in order to incite racial division. That just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. What I see is an elite class funding media that draws young white men deeper into racist conspiracies using dog whistles and innocent sounding but sinisterly motivated talking points. The alt right pipeline as it is often referred to by leftist leads vulnerable young men through a series of beliefs, often at their beginning accurate criticism of the modern world be it the problems of liberal democracy, or late stage capitalism, or dumb shit that radical feminists say. These base truths are then used to draw conclusions about culture, often that minority groups are asking for or being given more privileges then working class white people. This logic caries through painting an abrasive image of the left. Then through jokes and narrow statistics these young men are drawn closer into beliefs about groups and races of people, encouraging maybe not an outright racial hierarchy but certainly a belief that their are inherent differences between the races. Racialism. Over time though members are drawn closer and brought to believe in the outright separation of races or later into belief in the validity of an ethnostate. Conspiracy theories are circulated in alt right groups such as the great replacement. The modern American right consists of various levels of racialism and racism that are often on close communication. A conservative radio host might have as a guest a racialist book author, thus introducing his audience to those ideas further indoctrinating some of them. That same author might write about a facist figure such as Hitler, disavowing the uglier parts of his politics while justifying others. This means that some of his audience will be introduced to these ideas and some of those indoctrinated into a facist mindset. What‚Äôs generally at the center of the alt right are ideas like ‚Äúthe Jewish question‚Äù offering for example the idea that the Jews are behind conspiracies like the great replacement but also that they are the driving force behind the problems of late stage capitalism. My point is, the right either online or in media will often use true statements and a leap in logic to justify untrue conclusions. I see this here. Funny meme btw.')

('Libertarian Left', "This concept sucks sooo bad and it's so outwardly cringy that they'll inevitably surprise everyone as they turn out to be the greatest superheroes of our generation.")
('Centrist', 'I\'m just going to copy and past my comment from when I fist saw this hitting youtube:\n_____\n\nOkay, if I\'m taking a 100% objective look at this, these are (for the most part) genuinely interesting character concepts and designs.... If (and only if) they get written well. (Good luck writers.) (Also, I guess I should point out that I\'m not familiar with the old New Warriors, so I don\'t know how much, or if at all, these new ones clash with the old ones.)\n\nLike, a character who can create protective barriers, but only when protecting is actually a pretty cool idea for a power. That one specifically reminds me of Josuke Higashikata\'s Crazy Diamond, who can heal/repair anything, with the only exception being himself.  Similarly, a character with the entire internet to draw knowledge from seems just as interesting. My only issues power-wise is that beyond a VERY basic description, we have no idea what "Snowflake" does, "B-Negative" seems to really just be lazily phoning in a discount Morbius, and we get NO description of what "Trailblazer" even does.\n\nFrom a design perspective, I actually only really have issue with wannabe Morbius, because that\'s the one where I literally can not think of a time period where that would be seen as a good design, even for a 90\'s anti-hero. I normally I\'d take issue with "Trailblazer\'s" size, just because I\'m not a fan of fat characters in general. However, I then remembered that I hated My Hero Acedemia\'s Fat Gum initially because of his size and name, and I thought about how I actually do like the character now that I\'ve gotten a bit used to him and his power set. So yeah, assuming her power doesn\'t contradict her size, I don\'t really have an issue with her design. As for the rest, I don\'t particularly love any of the designs, but I do find them to be passable. I guess I could complain about how yet another "non-binary" character is drawn as just a short-haired chick, but that\'s such a common practice that I don\'t  really give a shit anymore.\n\nNow when it comes to the names, I\'ve seen some people in the comments talk about how generic "Screentime, Trailblazer, and B-Negative" are, but honestly, I can\'t really pin that on the writers. It\'s been 80 years since Superhero comics first came into existance, and at this point, all of the good, and even most of the bad, names have been taken. As for "Snowflake" and "Safe Space," if I ignore the obvious political stance they\'re meant to convey, I actually don\'t hate the names. We don\'t know exactly what "Snowflake\'s" power is, but we can presume something ice-based from it. As for "Safe Space",  his is actually very fitting for his powerset, and assumidly fits his personality as well. (You know, in a protective brother, not fragile SJW way.)\n\nAs to some of the nitpicky things I\'ve noticed in the comments: Yeah, "Safe Space" and "Snowflake" seem to have a pretty "close" and creepy bond for brother and sister, but then again it can\'t be any worse than 90\'s Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Also, yes, "Internet Gas" does sound stupid as hell, but no more stupid than some of the other ways people have gained powers in the comic-book worlds.\n\nAs a final note, we\'ve been telling SJWs for years now that if they want to have "inclusive" superheros, then they should make them themselves, rather than trying to convert old characters. In this case, that\'s exactly what they did, and I feel like we should support them for it. At the very least it\'s being written by Daniel Kibblesmith, who also wrote Loki (2019), and Black Panther VS Deadpool, so we do know that it\'s at least being written by a competent writer.\n\nEDIT Before Pressing Send:\n\nOkay, so I read the official post, and I was right, "Snowflake\'s" powers are ice based. Specifically, she throws snowflake-shaped ice shurikens. On the other hand, "Trailblazer" has the power of an infinite-pocket-dimension backpack where she can reach in and grab an item, but it\'s at random and not in her control. So yeah, design\'s kinda neutral on that one, and the name\'s not fitting. I would have gone with "Backpacker" if they\'re trying to give a hiking theme\nhttps://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/introducing-the-new-new-warriors\n\n____\n\nEDIT: /r/dontrespondjustdownvote')

('Libertarian Left', 'I mean. Libleft could be liberty, equality, order. the goal is that we all enjoy liberty equaly in an order without vertical hierarchy. Also it seems like I just began to write a wall of text to explain the libleft position on those 3 words so I guess the meme was accurate with all its imperfection because the meme ask a definition of the political value with only one  word that could mean basicaly anything depending of the interpretation we make. The fact is that the libleft inpretation of those words is more true and more useful that the one each other quadrant use. the concept of liberty for exemple in the libright interpretation, would be more accurately described as the dictatorship of the capital because the liberty they defend is based on the value of the property each person possesses, as such the interest of those who own nothing would not be respected and only those who can use their capital will rightfully influence the way society work in this paradigm, thus the level of liberty each person enjoy would vary according to their relative wealth so tbe less wealthy would not have the same liberty that the rich would enjoy. liberty without equality is the tyrany of the powerful. Secondly the order autright defend is, in fact, chaos. The autright claim that their subjective perspective of what normality should be the eternal order and they never acknoledge that their idea doesnt correspond to reality and thus the "order" they create always have to fight against the reality that the world doesnt comply with the delusion they live in,  because of the idea that they protect   their order against the true order in which every progressive movement strive toward, they create and entertain the dialectical struggle between reality and the illusion of a pure tradition, creating chaos, a struggle between the old and the new and a war between reality and the narative that keep them in power. A true order would be to accept and evolve with the world and its diversity rather than to fight for the violent dominion of one\'s subjective archetype over the other. In fact, Anarchy is order! damn I\'m tired please for the rest imagined that I continue my rant by explaining how equality need freedom to be useful and that equality alone without taking needs into account contradictory and that only free and equal access to the means and the fruits of production is can bring a more healthy type of equality. to conclude not only is liberty, order and equality not contradictory they have to evolve in unity with one another to realy bring the best of each concept and the libleft position is the only that acknowledge and impleament them as such. The Autright oppose Progress with Order and only create Chaos. The Libright oppose Equality with Liberty and Autleft oppose Liberty with Equality and both can only create Tyrany. Only with libleft   can Liberty and Equality, Anarchy and communism, colaborate and thrive, and bring true Order by evolving with the world instead of opposing it.')

('Libertarian Left', 'Jokes aside i\'d like to share some of my thoughts and dispel a lot of misinformation regarding subreddit bans, because imo this sub is at risk and we should understand why.\n\nthere are a couple of reasons why reddit bans subreddits, each one follows their own path from good standing to a ban. i\'m gonna try to be as unbiased as possible here, any terms I use are not my opinion, but rather the consensus of reddit as a whole. \n\n1. Subreddit starts violating reddit rules unironically. Userbase is by reddit terms "toxic". CA and GamersRiseUp were banned under this pathway, and PCM stands at a small-medium risk of being banned in this manner, but its not substantial\n\n2. Subreddit encourages real-world events that reddit does not want to be associated with. MDE, me_ira got banned under this pathway, CTH and T_D got quarantined under it. It is highly unlikely that PCM will be banned under such conditions\n\n3. The subreddit has large amounts of ironic jokes that when misconstrued can mean egregious reddit-wide rule violations. given that legoyoda got an instaban under such circumstances, and by nature was somewhat similar to PCM, I think that this is the highest risk that is posed to PCM.')
