They have a lot more legal teeth now (which is a good thing) so I generally don't pay as much attention to it. There are far more pressing issues in their communities, namely drug addiction.\n\nI looked at that Venezuelan coup attempt and it seems that it wasn't US backed so much as backed by mercenaries from the US. Now as a matter of fairness you could claim that that was just a cover story, but by the same token even the United States government isn't incompetent to the point they thought a fishing boat invasion would do anything.\n\nI think Venezuela could certainly use a coup though. Those people are suffering greatly.\n\n>Wealth disparity\n\nHere is something we could agree on for sure I just think we would probably disagree on the solutions to it. I'm personally of the mind that a more free approach in the form of UBI would be best, the more left minded people may prefer a more socialist approach. I take issue with the idea that billionaires haven't earned their money though. I think that Microsoft as a company is certainly worth its market capitalization and Bill Gates is well deserving of the wealth he obtained from it. I think that Amazon as a company is certainly worth its market capitalization and Jeff bezos is well deserving of the wealth he's obtained from it. however at a certain point the lock-up of all that value is detrimental to the health of the economy and the economic prosperity of the nation's citizens. I don't think policies that just directly tax people without providing an incentive for those that are wealthy to take alternative means that would be more beneficial for the society and are associated with tax breaks are healthy.\n\nFor example Jeff Bezos has that pet space company called Blue Oriigin. If we were to Levy new taxes on the super rich but associate large tax breaks with investment into industries the United States deems particularly valuable (like space) then we can have the best of both worlds.\n\n>Gerrymandering\n\nDistrict drawing should be done by algorithms\n\n>Treatment of minorities\n\nCops should wear body cams and there needs to either be less collusion between the prosecutor's office and police or an oversight department to make sure that they're not playing favorites\n\n>Influence of corporations\n\nLobbying is a gray area and I don't really want to get into it here but I want to make it clear that it's not all bad.

Of the percentage of people with citizenship of a given country, that work abroad temporarily while retaining citizenship of the original country, and who have kids in the original country, and so on. I think the solution to that would be that people who work only temporarily overseas but retain a permenant home and permenant citizenship in the original country get a vote, but anyone who resides permenantly and/or does not reside for work reasons in another country don't get a vote. \n\nFor example in the UK you get fuckloads of retirees who go off and live in Spain til they die, they shouldn't get a vote in the UK because whatever happens in the UK doesn't affect them, but they should get a vote in Spain because it affects them because that's where they live. Of course that doesn't make sense if they don't pay taxes in Spain because that's taxation without representation in the UK and representation without taxation in Spain for them, but I assume (though I don't know) Spain has some kind of retail tax that they're subject to, and maybe some kind of solution could be worked out with transferring their pension to be in Spain, or maybe they just pay the taxes on their pension to the Spanish govt at the rate they would in the UK, or whatever whatever. \n\nThe point is if someone stays in another country for good then the elections in their home country essentially no longer affect them and they shouldn't get a vote.")

We, the progressives in the party (I don’t like labels but I guess that one fits the best) have absolutely no desire for their platform at all, but every election we’re expected to fall in line, told were extremists and that they need to pander to the precious moderate vote (no offense). They assume well just vote for whatever toady they tout out on that stage because at least they’re closer to left than the other guy. Here’s an example of the constant way they split in our face: you just had a rather ugly nomination, you should in some regard make some concession to the large part of your base that just lost right? Picking Sanders as VP would be super popular and would secure those votes, picking Tulsi would at least show that you hear those voices in your party and would still get you your precious woman VP that you’re so concerned about. Instead they’re rumored to pick Kamala Harris, who is despised by most of us. Not even the slightest attempt to appeal to our agenda.\n\nWell we make up a good 30% or more of the party, and we’re coming to realize that this will always be how they operate as long as they assume they’ll get out vote no matter what. If anything, were finally *starting* to form a coalition, a coalition that says “you don’t own our vote, and you won’t until you start making concessions to what we want done.” To people like me, it’s not the end of the world if Trump gets re-elected, and I could care less honestly.')

But Christians only made up about 75-80% of the population. So obviously more christians were criminals than other groups.\n\nUnfortunately that really doesn't actually tell me much. For instance, how many converted after being put in there? It wouldn't surprise me that some people, while working through their guilt, used religion as a way to find personal forgiveness. There's also the question of how many are really Christian. I hate to use a No True Scotsman arguement, but if you point to a person who pushed drugs and was arrested for stabbing someone while robbing them, and told me they were a Christian before getting arrested, I would question how much that should count. Maybe an extreme example, but it still makes the numbers seem a bit off IMO.\n\nSo them we go back to the whole black people issue. We know for a fact that black people have been systematically held down. And a lot of the things that fucked with them wasn't done all that long ago. There are people alive today who went through segregation. And even after that ended, we know the governmebt did things like put drugs in black communities to make life harder for them. It's also been shown they get arrested for the same crimes more often than white people. They get harsher sentences, similar to how men get harsher sentences than women.\n\nIs there a problem with crime in the black community? Yes. Is it because they're black? No. Anyone who thinks it's because of pigment is dumb as shit. If they say it's because of culture, then we need to explore why they have a culture that has a crime problem. Not turn it back around to the color of their skin.\n\nPeople who bitch about other saying that stats are racist are just looking for an excuse to continue to justify their racism. No one is saying facts are racist, just that people use them for their racism.\n\nEdit: Also, trying to find out how to flair up on mobile. Or at least on this app")

I believe r/AgainstHateSubreddits still has a stickied post, where the moderator comment has details and links.  The stickied post was a response to the conspiracy theory that AHS is getting Right-Wing subs banned by spamming them with CP.\n\nThe long and short of the most recent development is this: certain Far-Right-Wing subreddits repeatedly allowed posts that are against the rules.  The admins start to take action.  All of a sudden, a bunch of CP is spammed in the subreddit.  The Right-Wingers say that this CP is the reason the sub gets banned, and that someone in AHS is doing it.\n\n\nThe admins have enough evidence of past harassment and ties to far-right subreddits, that they are on a damn near zero-tolerance policy.  This particular AHS moderator has been sent CP, accused of posting CP in other subs, doxxed, and harassed in real life.  The ~~mods~~ admins have investigated, and view it as a sustained harassment campaign.\n\nThis confuses people who come in and wonder what is going on. The admins aren\'t tolerating it anymore.  They are not willing to spend time sifting through the honestly curious people and the guys that "are just asking questions" (i.e. Why\'s it a big deal if there\'s nothing to hide?).\n\nSince, in the past, trolls were posting CP and saying it was this mod, the admins feel there is a similar pattern with the conspiracy of "AHS is posting CP to get Right-Wing subs banned".  They view it as a continuation of the harassment.\n\nBasically, besides the normal Reddit rules, don\'t accuse the admins and AHS of working together to post CP on Reddit.

Fled to the USSR after the Nazis came to power, lived in Moscow as a personal guest of Stalin until dying of old age in 1933.\n* Assata Shakur for authleft. A Maoist and Panther who later became a leading member of the Black Liberation Army and engaged in armed resistance against the united states as well as extrajudicial killings of drug dealers. Was at the top of the most wanted list for a while. She was eventually caught, but escaped and found political asylum in Cuba where she still lives today. She's also Tupac's aunt.\n* Sophie Scholl for libleft. She was a German socialist who tried to organize a pacifist resistance against Hitler, with ties to a lot of other resistance members. The Nazis caught her and sentenced her to death by guillotine, and she became a martyr to resistance groups all over Europe. Her writings on pacifism were later airdropped everywhere in Germany by the allies. There's a decent movie about her, *the Final Days*.\n* Simone de Beauvoir for libleft. Arguably the founder of second-wave feminism, the person to spark an interest in looking at the social rather than the legal relations between men and women. Also an influential libertarian socialist and anti-Soviet Marxist, as well as a founding existentialist philosopher.\n* Ursula Le Guin for libleft. Famous author of fiction with anarchist themes, also famous author of anarchist non-fiction. One of the greatest American writers ever, cited as a literary influence by many modern writers. She also singlehandedly collected and digitized a *lot* of old anarchist writings, and the modern revival of the anarchist tradition after the decline of anarchism between Catalonia and the 60s is partially due to her.")

Being a child is all gain and no loss for the most part, so supporting an ideology that closely reflects that mindset isn't farfetched, assuming you want to believe that a child has the intellectual capacity to form an actual opinion on politics in the first place.\n\nOlder people doing so are *generally speaking* in a similar sort of boat with regard to having a life of mostly gain with minimal losses; for example it is very easy to support something like M4A when you're in the lowest tax bracket and dont have to pay for any of it if passed. As for Sanders specifically, the millionaire is wagering that it's a popular enough idea to get him into the Oval Office (but we see how that's panning out).")

('Libertarian Right', 'Speaking purely philosophically, nothing that requires the positive actions of another can be termed a "right". Otherwise you get into absurd contradictions like, say, the Italian government having to choose who lives and who dies in the coronavirus outbreak. Are they invalidating people\'s rights by having to make those choices? There is no conceivable world where they could *not* be violating people\'s rights, then--at least not with the parameters given. There\'s not even the possibility of doing nothing and remaining morally irreproachable. Every action leads to violation. And if the simple physical limitations of reality can take away a right, how is that a right at all? \n\nWhat universal healthcare is, is a *privilege*. It\'s one we take for granted in the modern world, but one that is dearly paid for by the blood, sweat, and tears of our fathers. You could easily explain to a medieval peasant the right to bear arms or the right to free speech or the right to property. In many cases, some of the better off peasants and city-dwellers *had* such rights. But to unlimited healthcare at any point in time no matter the illness or circumstances? The very idea is absurd. The systems in place then just wouldn\'t be able to support it. Again, if all you have to do to invalidate a right is to travel back in time, how is that a right at all?\n\nFundamentally, I think it\'s a confusion and conflation between the concept of rights and the philosophical notion--which I agree with--that it is fundamentally okay to do whatever is necessary to preserve life. Almost everyone agrees it\'s all right to steal, say, medicine from some theoretical miser who\'s hoarding it to save a person\'s life. Even taking another\'s life is, while seen as regrettable, not exactly something wrong enough to punish. When a German soldier in WW1 later told the story of how he, during a gas attack, found that his gas mask was damaged and so took the mask off of a wounded soldier to save himself--leaving that boy to die painfully and miserably--no one even considered the idea of punishing him for it. Even if you like to think you\'d do otherwise in his shoes. \n\ntl;dr: health care isn\'t a human right, but we all instinctively know that it\'s just to abrogate rights for the sake of preservation of life. But because this is an unexpressed gut feeling, it often is uttered by the rational mind as "Health care is a human right" even though this is philosophically absurd.')

('Libertarian Right', "Right, but one big medical bill wipes out that surplus for thousands of subscribers. I'm in a financial industry that gives me reason to be looking at financial statements for a wide variety of companies, including health insurers and hospitals, and the hospitals grossly overinflate prices so that they're in the black from insurance payouts alone, since they're easier to collect from than individuals. To the degree that hospitals barely even try to get your portion of the bill from you before they just sell the debt off for pennies on the dollar to a collection company - it's quite literally not worth their time to chase down the $200 you owe them when they've already collected $2k from your insurance company. Something like 40% of people have medical collections on their credit report for bills they don't even know about (40% is probably wrong now, that was the number a few years ago before some regulations changed what appears on a report so may be different now).\n\nAnd hospitals aren't talking about struggling with treating uninsured patients in their management letters, but insurers (especially small ones) are definitely talking about increasing costs from hospitals and how to mitigate that. \n\nJust sharing what I see with a look behind the curtain that most people don't get. Definitely not a one-dimensional problem, but it's naive when people act like the hospitals are the good guys here.")
('Libertarian Right', "I said more to another reply, but insurers definitely don't want to see healthcare costs continue to rise. The problem is multifaceted - hospitals overcharge out of the gate expecting insurance companies to offset the cost for the uninsured and to pad their bottom line. Most health insurance is a layer or two removed from the end patient, so the companies can charge a little more than they might otherwise be able to. And since insurance companies keep the lights on at a hospital, most don't really care if the patient pays their portion of the bill or not, so they don't even bother putting resources towards trying to collect the remainder of a bill from patients most of the time. IMO the system needs to be brought under control via some regulation and regulatory changes before we address who pays the final bill if we want it to be sustainable. \n\nAs we're all seeing during this pandemic crisis though, being a doctor or nurse is fucking hard. In the best of times, you're talking about a 12+ hour shift where one brief mental lapse could literally kill someone. Not a lot of people can do that job, and those that can definitely deserve to be paid extremely well.")

What crimes (and contexts of crimes) deserve denying the criminal’s human rights would be codified by an entity that is separate from the state as a safeguard. This entity would aim to protect society over the criminal, but also acknowledge the importance of what human rights entail and represent. The denial of human rights would also be preventive of further related crimes rather than punitive. This entity could also decide on a case-by-case basis if needed. The state would be merely an actor that enforces the laws with no say in when denial of human rights is applied.\n\nSome examples:  \n\nTerrorism - torture ok, no right to trial if it’s reasonably deemed useless (e.g. caught making bombs or armed after committing an attack), no right to life (can be stood up against a wall if no longer useful in the investigation)  \n\nHard drug smuggler - torture ok, otherwise all human rights granted  \n\nSoft drug smuggler - all human rights granted. \n\nDrug dealer or user, hard or soft- all human rights granted. \n\nOrganized crime, violent - torture ok, no right to trial, no right to life  \n\nOrganized crime, non-violent - all human rights granted  \n\nRapist - all human rights granted. \n\nRape ring - torture ok  \n\nIn the end, the denial of human rights wouldn’t be a kneejerk reaction, but an authorization of tools and methods when the situation necessitates their use in protecting greater society.

Also it seems like I just began to write a wall of text to explain the libleft position on those 3 words so I guess the meme was accurate with all its imperfection because the meme ask a definition of the political value with only one  word that could mean basicaly anything depending of the interpretation we make. The fact is that the libleft inpretation of those words is more true and more useful that the one each other quadrant use. the concept of liberty for exemple in the libright interpretation, would be more accurately described as the dictatorship of the capital because the liberty they defend is based on the value of the property each person possesses, as such the interest of those who own nothing would not be respected and only those who can use their capital will rightfully influence the way society work in this paradigm, thus the level of liberty each person enjoy would vary according to their relative wealth so tbe less wealthy would not have the same liberty that the rich would enjoy. liberty without equality is the tyrany of the powerful. Secondly the order autright defend is, in fact, chaos. The autright claim that their subjective perspective of what normality should be the eternal order and they never acknoledge that their idea doesnt correspond to reality and thus the "order" they create always have to fight against the reality that the world doesnt comply with the delusion they live in,  because of the idea that they protect   their order against the true order in which every progressive movement strive toward, they create and entertain the dialectical struggle between reality and the illusion of a pure tradition, creating chaos, a struggle between the old and the new and a war between reality and the narative that keep them in power. A true order would be to accept and evolve with the world and its diversity rather than to fight for the violent dominion of one\'s subjective archetype over the other. In fact, Anarchy is order! damn I\'m tired please for the rest imagined that I continue my rant by explaining how equality need freedom to be useful and that equality alone without taking needs into account contradictory and that only free and equal access to the means and the fruits of production is can bring a more healthy type of equality. to conclude not only is liberty, order and equality not contradictory they have to evolve in unity with one another to realy bring the best of each concept and the libleft position is the only that acknowledge and impleament them as such. The Autright oppose Progress with Order and only create Chaos. The Libright oppose Equality with Liberty and Autleft oppose Liberty with Equality and both can only create Tyrany. Only with libleft   can Liberty and Equality, Anarchy and communism, colaborate and thrive, and bring true Order by evolving with the world instead of opposing it.')

If what you claim were true, it doesn't explain why African nobility was just as black as African peasantry. Wouldn't the nobles who stayed inside all day have evolved white skin?

The higher on the pyramid a person is, the more choosy they can be for who they marry. Over time, the upper class isn’t just lighter because they don’t work in the sun, they are genetically lighter skinned. \n\n2. Two possible explanations. Explanation one: The work of the upper classes in these societies put them in the sun a lot. Maybe their cultures focused on martial prowess, traveling, or watching over herds and flocks. Explanation 2: Perhaps the process described in one only occurs for people whose skin color changes a lot depending on the amount of sun they have. Some people with very light skin may barely get darker even after frying in the sun. The same might be true for people with very dark skin. \n\n3.

There is no certainty here that the securities will be later available for the seller to actually deliver to the buyer at the time of delivery. Naked short selling has been considered a way of manipulating the price of securities. As the short sellers can increase supply very fast, there is a rapid drop in the price of the security. Nervous investors then start closing their long positions which continues to increase supply and there is little if any demand. The short sellers are then able to easily buy back what they short sold at a much lower price.\n\nIt’s selling a stock short without ever holding to stock for even half a second. It’s 100% market manipulation and now the higher ups are getting mad that WSB 100% called them on their game, found that if you find a group of people that instead of getting scared and selling, just buy more stock, that makes short selling is literally the dumbest most dangerous shit in the fucking world.')

Were that true, though, Saudi Arabia would be a leftist power and I don\'t think that quite adds up.

What\'s.... ironic (?) about the whole thing is how much China\'s economic policy making and the USA\'s policy making have in common, even though one is ostensibly "right" and the other "left". I think the USA is about as honest in being "free market" as China is honest about being "Communist".

I support a Georgist land rent, for example, as well as carbon taxes; so long as fair prices are paid, rich people are welcome to behave however they want.

The tax proceeds can go to all costs related to COVID treatment, as well as paying the deceased an amount that is, say, equal to some reasonable estimate of the actuarial value of their life. In practice, these costs are so high that it would be prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the population to pay the tax. I don't care about the 1% that can still afford it -- as far as I'm concerned, if some people are willing to pay that tax then that would actually a good outcome, because it's a transfer of wealth from irresponsible people to those who need medical treatment.

Now imagine there's a pharmaceutical company with a factory that is dumping their waste into the local water supply. To simplify, let's make it a small company with just one director and two hundred workers. The water supply supplies drinking water to the local town with a population of 2000.

Stalin was aware even a position like a secretary, if used correctly, could decide the fate of a nation, mostly becausr thats what he did himself to get to power.\n\nAlso the purges happened years before Germany attacked and werent close to the reason the USSR suffered such losses.\n\nThe main reason for the huge losses of the USSR were mainly how Germany saw this as a war of extermination so plans were made to kill as many Soviets as possible, be it active combatant, POW or civilian.\n\nAnd the second was that the USSR was undergoing a full re-organization and it was moving its units around to make a more modern unit make-up and distribution of forces. Most of the initial engagements caught many Soviet units without a single artillery piece and were forced to use tanks in suicide charges to keep the German artillety occupied while the infantry moved in.\n\nAs to why said re-organization was happening when it did  Stalin thought that Hitler would have been a moron to open a second front while at war with Britain as that kind of attack would leave Germany with a bleak future being hammered by numerically superior forces in 2 sides.\n\nWhich was proven right, once the Soviet military organized properly.\n\nAlso, the Holodomor was mostly a result of the USSR inhereting a almost medieval farming infrastructure, which was prone to local famines due to poor communication, techniques and storing. As the Holodomor was a result of a widespread famine in many parts of the USSR, including Kazakhistan who lost around 40% of its population to famine.\n\nThose were harsh years which had seen record droughts throughout the entirety of the USSR, and now it had much higher needs for food due to the rapid industrialization, which also caused a lack of manpower to farm(since agriculture was still behind techbologically as I said before, manual labour was still the main producer). Also many Kulaks(wealthy peasantry) sabotaged their harvests in protest to land redistribution.')

Not because you involved yourself with them but because they involved themselves with you. At that point, it's literally a penalty for existing. \n\nBut none of that even addresses main point. The main point is that you're correct, taxes way way way work out in my favor. They provide all the tools and resources I need to live a comfortable life with minimum effort. But that doesn't justify them. I might be fine with it, but lots of people aren't. It is wrong of me to force other people to live by my rules. A very analogous comparison is American slavery. Pretty much everyone involved in slavery benefited from it. That's not to say it was preferable to everyone involved but that even the slaves ended up having better lives that offered education, food, shelter, and futures for their children that morphed into one of the best futures imaginable. \n\nStill, it's easy to see how wrong it is, how immoral you need to be to compel behavior of people to your own advantage. If taxation really is to everyone's benefit, the solution is to make them optional. People who are benefited will happily contribute to something that is benefiting them. And if it's not contributed to, obviously people find their own use if their money more beneficial to their end goals. Exactly like if slavery would have been optional, there would have been pretty much zero slaves.")

('Libertarian Left', "Yeah I think that was poor branding from the start and he got stuck with it. I think you have to advocate for socialism or don't. He tried to call himself a socialist whilst advocating for social democracy.")
('Libertarian Left', "He didn't really. Afaik he said he's a social democrat, which news outlets reported as 'Bernie is socialist!!11!1 Bad for America!11!1'\n\nHe may have said he's a democratic socialist though, I don't remember exactly and too lazy to look up. Definitely one of the two though.")
('Libertarian Left', "Mostly because he was being labelled a socialist anyway. There's two big factors - First, what Americans think is 'Socialism' is really moderate left, so any SOCDEM policy is going to be labelled Socialism; Second, he wanted to take the label and own it so it couldn't be used as a weapon against him.\n\nAnd for the most part, he succeeded. His campaign in 2016 and now started the ball rolling. Socialism was a 'scary word' for a long time. It was perceived in America as downright evil. What Bernie did was talk about good policies like M4A - and then call them Socialism. Wait a minute - THAT'S what Socialism is? He's taken the bite out of the word for an entire generation. It saddens me that he won't live to see the shift in America, but it is inevitable at this point as the GE and Boomers die off.")
('Libertarian Left', "Kind of, but not the CNT-FAI. He wanted to join the Stalinist-led International Brigades, but Harry Pollitt shuffled him into the POUM out of personal dislike or something. It's been a while since I read Homage to Catalonia, but he definitely started out affiliated with the Stalinist British Communist Party, and came home a supporter of the broadly leftcom Independent Labour Party.")
('Libertarian Left', 'I mean. Orwell kept his POUM sympathies till his death, and the major of the parties which formed the POUM were trots who broke with Trotsky. If you want to get into details Orwell maintained that the Russian revolution had been, on balance, a positive before Stalin betrayed it, but that he would seek a democratic transition to a socialist system in Britain rather than a violent revolution. I guess you could call him a democratic socialist with Trotskyist sympathies, if you want. Seeing as he desired a move to the socialist mode of production he was most definitely a *communist*, in the actual sense of that word, just not a Stalinist.')
('Libertarian Left', 'Also the view of the Soviet Union as a degenerated workers\' state, which together with the permanent revolution form pretty much the largest components of Trotskyist theory. And the POUM was formed partially from a party which had previously openly identified itself as a part of the international left opposition, and which Trotsky up until... 1936?... had supported. Hence why I said "approximately Trotskyist". But you\'re right, Trotsky himself didn\'t like them much, and the other half of POUM wasn\'t exactly Trotskyist. It\'s kind of obscure, but yeah.')
('Libertarian Left', '*An important note:* are you talking about the animated movie? Because they changed the ending in the movie that completely reverses the message of the story. I remember that in the ending of the animated movie the original farm owners return to "liberate" the animals from their tyranny and the animals are overjoyed (thus implicitly discrediting the animals\' entire revolutionary endeavor). *This is not* how the book ended. The book never invalidates the animals\' revolution, but rather warns about the dangers of letting a revolution be hijacked by reactionary interests, which is also in line with the general message of Nineteen Eighty-Four (as well as being in line with Orwell\'s views as favourable towards socialism but opposed to Stalinism).  \n\n\nIf you\'ve ever read about the history of the Russian Revolution and how things evolved from 1900 to about 1921, Animal Farm is a detailed critique of how and where the Russian Revolution backfired in this process, and how things really started to become problematic when Lenin and the Bolshevik party consolidated power. Major events in that story correspond to major events in the Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war.')

('Libertarian Left', "> I wouldn't consider this view exclusive from Trotskyists.\n\nI guess the Italian communists used the term as well, but Trotsky introduced it and it's mainly associated with the international left opposition. You won't find it many places outside Trotskyists and the London Bureau (and the Dutch-Germans), but you're right that POUM were London Bureau rather than Trot. Regardless, there won't be many people on a meme sub who know what that means, and Trotskyism is kind of the closest thing a lot of people are familiar with.")

Similarly I know Prods who think the DUP are backwards bastards, with their anti gay marriage and anti-abortion views.

You might not actively increase a person's suffering, and even try to reverse it, but from the moment your disrespect for someone goes from simply disliking something they do to disliking something which is a fundamental part of them, there's no moral barriers between you and harming them -or even just being complacent in someone else harming them.

('Libertarian Left', 'Kanye West has become the president\n\n**November 4th, 2020**\n\nAgainst all odds, Kanye West has won the presidency through the sheer power of his fanboys/girls and his new release "Like a President ft. LonelyIsland".\n\nAs the day comes to an end, many news outlets speculate on his policies, replaying old clips of comedic and nonsensical things.\n\n-\t- - \n\n**November 7th, 2020**\n\nKanye West has completely shut the borders, no one in, no one out, under the guise of coronavirus containment, research begins on a method of obscuring the united states.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**February 1st, 2021**\n\nBy now people are wondering what Kanye’s grand plan is, a few memes have broken out, comparing the situation to Wakanda, but no one bats an eye.\n\nThe right doesn’t care what he does, as the economy is booming thanks to kanye practically resurrecting the economy with his new merch “U.S. Freedom Bonds”.\n\nNo one knows how they’re made, but owning just one makes you feel incredibly powerful, as though you were young again.\n\nHowever, Kanye only sells them in small batches.\n\nDue to this, billionaires have invested upwards of trillions of dollars into making sure they get their hands on love bonds, with the US government being the only one who has any idea what they’re made out of, causing counterfeits and copycats to be laughable.\n\nThe Left lets him do what he wants as he recently came out as gay, polyamorous, and even discovered a new sexuality, his male partner, Tyler Demetri Joonies, is an astrophysicist in the year 2054, even though Kanye has not met him, he pronounces his love to him and comes out as the first Futur-sexual.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**December 25th, 2021**\n\nThe U.S. has completely paid off their debt to china, healthcare is free not because Kanye set up an elaborate social net to catch people who can’t afford insurance, but because his Freedom Bonds earned so much money that hospitals have enough money to run at full capacity for 300 years.\n\nResearch into methods of turning the US invisible are still ongoing, but with promising results.\n\nA rich business man named [REDACTED] managed to smuggle a Freedom Bond out of the US, through his private yacht.\n\nTo his surprise, as soon as he reached international waters the bond lost its brilliant color, and he no longer felt young, in fact, he felt as though he was older than he was.\n\nHe begins plans to fund the reverse engineering of a freedom bond.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**July 4th, 2022**\n\nPresident Kanye has withdrawn all military troops, auxiliary or otherwise, stating that “The United States have become too disconnected on a global scale to continue these dangerous war games”\n\nDespite what seems to be a sudden withdrawing of troops, there are no insurrections, and the middle east has miraculously become more stable.\n\nFreedom.Inc, established to reverse engineer freedom bonds, has made significant progress, although it is unable to determine the makeup, they conclude that they are made with 100% Local Materials, hence why they don’t work outside of the US.\n\nKanye declares that the project to close off america via “an invisibility cloak” has concluded, with less than satisfactory results.\n\nWill instead be funding Clean Nuclear Energy.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**April 17th, 2023**\n\nNuclear Power Plants have popped up across the nation, adding free electricity and utilities to the benefits of being an American, alongside healthcare, simply because electricity is so cheap that it costs more to withhold it than it does to let everyone have it.\n\nFreedom Inc have discovered the secret behind the legendary Freedom Bonds, its the will of the American People.\n\nUsing an energized form of the American “Spirit” Kanye was able to create mythical bonds which restore vigor to anyone, they suspect he harvests it during his numerous rallies and tours.\n\nEveryone outside of America has been declared a 1st-ish world country, with many people, rich and poor alike, clamoring to be let in.\n\nEveryone is proud of anything slightly close to America, clothes and appliances rumored to be made in america (since america exports nothing) are regarded as rare collectibles, similar to a beatles record.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**August 29th, 2023**\n\nKanye’s first term is beginning to end, but everyone knows that a re-election would be a landslide, America is positively glowing, and even has China owing them vast sums of money.\n\nFreedom Bonds only get stronger as the american spirit is raised higher and higher by their enigmatic leader, but replications are unsuccessful.\n\nIn an effort to combat him, the Democrats and the Republicans have merged into one party, the Republicrats, even with this, they stand no chance.\n\nThe whole world envied America, but soon, things would change, Kanye had been watching Black Panther everyday since his presidency, and he knew he needed a way to block America off from the world.\n\nLuckily, there were a massive amount of nuclear power plants sitting around the country.\n\nKanye had a plan.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 21st, 2024**\n\nConsidering the circumstances, it was actually a tossup as to who would win the presidency, with the Republicrats running on a direct, yet split platform.\n\nAs though they had been frankenstiened together, their policies were a mix between far left and far right. \n\nSurprisingly, 40% loved it.\n\nHowever, Kanye had an ace up his sleeve.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 23rd, 2024**\n\nMillions of powerplants across the nation had malfunctioned, practically erupting in radiation, with the estimated death tolls to be somewhere in the real of 4 million.\n\nKanye responded like a hardened president, containing the disasters, safeproofing the unaffected plants, and launching an investigation into what caused the disaster. \n\nTo the rest of the world, the US had exploded, with reported deaths of 100 million.\n\nAmerica went from being the 1st world country to a 3rd world country overnight.\n\nSpecial clearance was needed to even fly over the once glorious states, and you can forget about landing, a select few representatives were chosen to brave the dangers of the US, each country sending them with methods to resist the radiation which had surely overtaken the land.\n\nBut, to the Americans, nothing of that scale happened. \n\nKanye had it controlled so well it was almost as though he had prepared specifically for this.\n\nTruthfully, only around 500k people died, most being prisoners or so elderly that even freedom bonds couldn’t preserve them for much longer.\n\nThe investigation finished, arresting prominent members of the Republicrats Party for orchestrating a coup.\n\nKanye had achieved his Wakanda, and he still had 4 more years to be president.\n\nThis truly is the best timeline.')

He is a prime sample of the politicians who put the US in the shitty political position it is in now. \nApart from that it is pretty obvious that he is not mentally fit enough to be president, even the DNC hid him away for the last bit of the election out of fear he would show how senile he is again. I don’t know who will effectively be president, because someone as spineless as Biden who is also mentally in an 1973 ice cream shop will do nothing to mildly inconvenience himself.

('Authoritarian Right', 'A good argument for monarchy is "skin in the game". In a monarchy the longterm interest of the rulers align with the long term interests of the subjects. The better the nation is doing the more powerful the monarch becomes. Therefore he wants his nation to do well. His fate and the rest of his life is bound to the future of his nation if the nation is doing bad so is he. In a democracy this is not the case the only thing politicians have to care about is the next election so they will plot to take more power by any means even if it is bad for the country. For example the massive debt of almost every democratic nation. While making debts is bad for the country it is good for the politician because spending is extremely popular with voters because it gives them money in the short term. For a monarch this is not the case because he knows that the debts won\'t disappear and that he or his children will have to deal with them. \n\nAnother argument is arguing from the iron law of oligarchy. "Regardless of the egalitarian principles they profess, human collectives are always ruled by a small minority of leaders who set the important elements of the social and political agenda." In modern democratic society the ruling class aren\'t only the politicians they are acctualy the weakest among the rulers. In democracy the rulers are people with social power those who shape opinions, the owners of news cooperations, big businesses and actors. They determine the long term societal context in which political opinions are formed and which opinions are outside the social acceptedness. In real monarchies(were the monarch and the nobility acctualy have power so not Britain) the people with power can be identified as such and don\'t rule secretly from the shadows. \n\nMonarchy is the most stable form of government. It has existed for thousands of years. Compared to monarchy all other forms of government were incredibility short lived. And just look at modern democracies how the political discours radicalises itself and becomes extremely toxic. Look at countries like the US how much both sides hate each other and how this makes the country in able to act. Everything becomes politicised. The entire society turns against itself. Democracy is incredibly instable and will not be able to sustain itself for thousands of years as monarchy has. \n\nThere are hundreds more arguments for monarchy but those are a few big ones. If you are interested I can give you a few more arguments and provide you with a few sources. I hope I was able to show you that monachism is a serious political position with political philosophy supporting it and not just European sentimentalusm.')

Don't have to worry about the Hive's drones since The Veteran's private army keeps them away. Hell, my body installation business keeps his soldiers juiced up and ready for war.
