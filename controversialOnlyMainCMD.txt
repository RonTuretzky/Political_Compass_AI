('Libertarian Right', "The world would be better if we lived in a society where lactating women could get jobs selling their breast milk as an alternative to cow milk. Just think about it, human breast milk is healthier for humans than cows milk, and we could reduce the amount of cows in factory farms; reduce the amount of cows in general, which would reduce the amount of methane going into the atmosphere and have less of an affect on climate change. Women could unionize to have good working conditions with decent pay and benefits, which would actually make the milk taste better if they were under less stress. Although it will be mandatory to be drug free, and maybe have regular drug tests to insure the quality of milk, that might actually motivate struggling women to quit drugs and get off the streets by selling breast milk. Women with hyperlactation would have an outlet for their excess milk production and be compensated for all the milk they sell, while women who under produce could easily buy the amount of breast milk they need from the grocery store. Just imagine having an omelet, cheesy pasta, or chocolate milk but made with human breast milk; that would be pretty wild by todays standards. The only downside is that drinking breast milk would be normalized and no one would masturbate to the idea of drinking from lactating titties, because that is indeed a problem and everyone totally masturbates to lactating titties. Don't turn this into a copy pasta or I will ejaculate into your nightmares; I am like Freddy Krueger, but horny, and I would totally fill your dreams with spermy wormies.")

I think almost everyone goes through a phase like that. \n\nBut the people that seem to be thriving never have it as good as we think they do. It sucks being alone, it also sucks being so afraid being alone that you stay with people who treat you like shit.

('Libertarian Right', "Well, since you bring these points let's review them 1 by one.\n\n1. John mccain has a photo taken during the maidan revolution standing right to a neonazi. \n\nThis doesn't prove anything, there are photos of putin and every us president in the last years, that does not prove they agree politically or are using one another. A photo of 2 people in one event only proves that they were in that event and (consequentially) support that event, nothing more.\n\n2. Neocons play geopolitics in order to further the goals of their own countries. And as such US politicians seek to mantain US superpower monopoly\n\nOkay, that has literally always been true. Literally every state tries to influence other states to their interest. That is what russia does when it supports certain parties or conflicts within countries or intervenes in others. I don't know what this brings to the table.\n\n3. Otan promised not to expand east, yet did. \n\nVery overused and false argument.\nFirst it was a verbal promise not to move nato to east germany after reunification, that was what was talked about, since by then the USSR still existed and thus the only thing east of east germany, was the USSR. \n\nSo it's ovbious they weren't asking for NATO not to include themselves in nato. \n\nSecond, there is no document that states that NATO couldn't welcome new members after.\n\nThird, after the colapse (1997 I think) of the USSR russia agreed with NATO that they couldn't veto each other, meaning russia agreed that Nato could welcome new member states. \n\nSo, this idea that nato is attacking russia is bulshit, not only because of the previously stated, but because NATO is a military alliance and has never gained new members by conquest, only via diplomacy and its also a very sweet deal if you can join, you get the greatest military force ever in history to protect you from any attack if you can join, which country concerned with exterior threats wouldn't want that?? \n\n\nNow there are some points that I don't understand so I'll await your response. \n\n1. What are the political views of yuschenko (the candidate), that make him a neonazi? Because right now we only have smear by association via his wife. \n2. What work did the wife do for the Wh? Were they aware of their ideas? Even if they were, it would not be the first time WH has supported an unethicsl party that better  suit their interests. That doesn't mean the support was illegitimate. \n\nAnd lastly, why do you talk about the state of affairs previous to the euromaidan, and not after that or the current situation?. That would seem more relevant into if ukraine has shitty nazi ideas today and thus if we should support them today that dubious association smears on previous politicians and cherrypicked and missrepresented agreements, that were also already superceded by later agreements.\n\nI'll grant you some points, evidently USA had an interest in mantaining it's superpower monopoly, and thus it had an interest in trying to separate ukraine from russia, that does not mean ukrainians didn't share this interest as well, as most do today. It's also not the only state that does it, heck russian interference in elections round the world makes the news every saturday.\n\nBut what you presented right here is Russian propaganda, that much is clear. \n\nI do not know if you willingly constructed this argument yourself or just got convinced by the fallacies. Lastly I understand it's for the meme and tradition on this sub, but try not to strawman your counterpart, its inelegant.")

There is a pretty big jump from "McCain took pictures with Oleh" to "It was McCains job to push Yanukovych out of Ukraine" and when I say pretty big jump, I mean it has zero evidence supporting it.\n3. "That woman" worked in the U.S. treasury, and the fact that she previously worked in the white house doesn\'t mean that she was some sort of nazi plant. There is no evidence that she had any impact in how Ukraine was governed.\n4. Why does it matter what George Friedman says? He doesn\'t work in the U.S. government, nor does he have any access to any information that would make this quote a smoking gun.\n5. I want to make this very clear, NATO NEVER promised not to expand east, it did not happen, that is a myth. The myth that NATO promised not to expand east comes from a verbal agreement with no evidence that these verbal promises actually occurred, and HARD evidence that this "agreement" had no legal precedent.\n6. The fact that russia is invading Ukraine so they don\'t join NATO isn\'t some kind of conspiracy. It is most certainly what is happening, they did the same thing to Georgia and it\'s why they\'ve been backing the separatists in Ukraine this whole time. This of course has nothing to do with nazi\'s so I\'m not sure why you\'ve brought it up.\n7. In war there are rarely good sides, this is one of those cases. Ukraine did NOTHING to warrant this, the people of Ukraine did nothing to deserve this suffering, on one side you have an imperialist war machine attempting to forcefully exert its power over a smaller country, and on the other you have a people doing everything they can to defend their home and family. Russia has no reason to be doing this, you cannot strike someone for no reason and then hide behind the "there are no good sides in war" card, Ukraine did nothing to provoke this. This is an act of unchecked aggression and Ukraine is 100% the good guy in this situation.\n\nAlso, Ukraine has a Jewish president and russia bombed a holocaust memorial lmao')

Also it seems like I just began to write a wall of text to explain the libleft position on those 3 words so I guess the meme was accurate with all its imperfection because the meme ask a definition of the political value with only one  word that could mean basicaly anything depending of the interpretation we make. The fact is that the libleft inpretation of those words is more true and more useful that the one each other quadrant use. the concept of liberty for exemple in the libright interpretation, would be more accurately described as the dictatorship of the capital because the liberty they defend is based on the value of the property each person possesses, as such the interest of those who own nothing would not be respected and only those who can use their capital will rightfully influence the way society work in this paradigm, thus the level of liberty each person enjoy would vary according to their relative wealth so tbe less wealthy would not have the same liberty that the rich would enjoy. liberty without equality is the tyrany of the powerful. Secondly the order autright defend is, in fact, chaos. The autright claim that their subjective perspective of what normality should be the eternal order and they never acknoledge that their idea doesnt correspond to reality and thus the "order" they create always have to fight against the reality that the world doesnt comply with the delusion they live in,  because of the idea that they protect   their order against the true order in which every progressive movement strive toward, they create and entertain the dialectical struggle between reality and the illusion of a pure tradition, creating chaos, a struggle between the old and the new and a war between reality and the narative that keep them in power. A true order would be to accept and evolve with the world and its diversity rather than to fight for the violent dominion of one\'s subjective archetype over the other. In fact, Anarchy is order! damn I\'m tired please for the rest imagined that I continue my rant by explaining how equality need freedom to be useful and that equality alone without taking needs into account contradictory and that only free and equal access to the means and the fruits of production is can bring a more healthy type of equality. to conclude not only is liberty, order and equality not contradictory they have to evolve in unity with one another to realy bring the best of each concept and the libleft position is the only that acknowledge and impleament them as such. The Autright oppose Progress with Order and only create Chaos. The Libright oppose Equality with Liberty and Autleft oppose Liberty with Equality and both can only create Tyrany. Only with libleft   can Liberty and Equality, Anarchy and communism, colaborate and thrive, and bring true Order by evolving with the world instead of opposing it.')

('Libertarian Left', 'Kanye West has become the president\n\n**November 4th, 2020**\n\nAgainst all odds, Kanye West has won the presidency through the sheer power of his fanboys/girls and his new release "Like a President ft. LonelyIsland".\n\nAs the day comes to an end, many news outlets speculate on his policies, replaying old clips of comedic and nonsensical things.\n\n-\t- - \n\n**November 7th, 2020**\n\nKanye West has completely shut the borders, no one in, no one out, under the guise of coronavirus containment, research begins on a method of obscuring the united states.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**February 1st, 2021**\n\nBy now people are wondering what Kanye’s grand plan is, a few memes have broken out, comparing the situation to Wakanda, but no one bats an eye.\n\nThe right doesn’t care what he does, as the economy is booming thanks to kanye practically resurrecting the economy with his new merch “U.S. Freedom Bonds”.\n\nNo one knows how they’re made, but owning just one makes you feel incredibly powerful, as though you were young again.\n\nHowever, Kanye only sells them in small batches.\n\nDue to this, billionaires have invested upwards of trillions of dollars into making sure they get their hands on love bonds, with the US government being the only one who has any idea what they’re made out of, causing counterfeits and copycats to be laughable.\n\nThe Left lets him do what he wants as he recently came out as gay, polyamorous, and even discovered a new sexuality, his male partner, Tyler Demetri Joonies, is an astrophysicist in the year 2054, even though Kanye has not met him, he pronounces his love to him and comes out as the first Futur-sexual.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**December 25th, 2021**\n\nThe U.S. has completely paid off their debt to china, healthcare is free not because Kanye set up an elaborate social net to catch people who can’t afford insurance, but because his Freedom Bonds earned so much money that hospitals have enough money to run at full capacity for 300 years.\n\nResearch into methods of turning the US invisible are still ongoing, but with promising results.\n\nA rich business man named [REDACTED] managed to smuggle a Freedom Bond out of the US, through his private yacht.\n\nTo his surprise, as soon as he reached international waters the bond lost its brilliant color, and he no longer felt young, in fact, he felt as though he was older than he was.\n\nHe begins plans to fund the reverse engineering of a freedom bond.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**July 4th, 2022**\n\nPresident Kanye has withdrawn all military troops, auxiliary or otherwise, stating that “The United States have become too disconnected on a global scale to continue these dangerous war games”\n\nDespite what seems to be a sudden withdrawing of troops, there are no insurrections, and the middle east has miraculously become more stable.\n\nFreedom.Inc, established to reverse engineer freedom bonds, has made significant progress, although it is unable to determine the makeup, they conclude that they are made with 100% Local Materials, hence why they don’t work outside of the US.\n\nKanye declares that the project to close off america via “an invisibility cloak” has concluded, with less than satisfactory results.\n\nWill instead be funding Clean Nuclear Energy.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**April 17th, 2023**\n\nNuclear Power Plants have popped up across the nation, adding free electricity and utilities to the benefits of being an American, alongside healthcare, simply because electricity is so cheap that it costs more to withhold it than it does to let everyone have it.\n\nFreedom Inc have discovered the secret behind the legendary Freedom Bonds, its the will of the American People.\n\nUsing an energized form of the American “Spirit” Kanye was able to create mythical bonds which restore vigor to anyone, they suspect he harvests it during his numerous rallies and tours.\n\nEveryone outside of America has been declared a 1st-ish world country, with many people, rich and poor alike, clamoring to be let in.\n\nEveryone is proud of anything slightly close to America, clothes and appliances rumored to be made in america (since america exports nothing) are regarded as rare collectibles, similar to a beatles record.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**August 29th, 2023**\n\nKanye’s first term is beginning to end, but everyone knows that a re-election would be a landslide, America is positively glowing, and even has China owing them vast sums of money.\n\nFreedom Bonds only get stronger as the american spirit is raised higher and higher by their enigmatic leader, but replications are unsuccessful.\n\nIn an effort to combat him, the Democrats and the Republicans have merged into one party, the Republicrats, even with this, they stand no chance.\n\nThe whole world envied America, but soon, things would change, Kanye had been watching Black Panther everyday since his presidency, and he knew he needed a way to block America off from the world.\n\nLuckily, there were a massive amount of nuclear power plants sitting around the country.\n\nKanye had a plan.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 21st, 2024**\n\nConsidering the circumstances, it was actually a tossup as to who would win the presidency, with the Republicrats running on a direct, yet split platform.\n\nAs though they had been frankenstiened together, their policies were a mix between far left and far right. \n\nSurprisingly, 40% loved it.\n\nHowever, Kanye had an ace up his sleeve.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 23rd, 2024**\n\nMillions of powerplants across the nation had malfunctioned, practically erupting in radiation, with the estimated death tolls to be somewhere in the real of 4 million.\n\nKanye responded like a hardened president, containing the disasters, safeproofing the unaffected plants, and launching an investigation into what caused the disaster. \n\nTo the rest of the world, the US had exploded, with reported deaths of 100 million.\n\nAmerica went from being the 1st world country to a 3rd world country overnight.\n\nSpecial clearance was needed to even fly over the once glorious states, and you can forget about landing, a select few representatives were chosen to brave the dangers of the US, each country sending them with methods to resist the radiation which had surely overtaken the land.\n\nBut, to the Americans, nothing of that scale happened. \n\nKanye had it controlled so well it was almost as though he had prepared specifically for this.\n\nTruthfully, only around 500k people died, most being prisoners or so elderly that even freedom bonds couldn’t preserve them for much longer.\n\nThe investigation finished, arresting prominent members of the Republicrats Party for orchestrating a coup.\n\nKanye had achieved his Wakanda, and he still had 4 more years to be president.\n\nThis truly is the best timeline.')

Now, I think being anti-abortion is actually what the liberatarian stance *should* be, even though it's not the typical stance (a la JoJo).
