It\'s not just a quaint little story like some episode of a kids show that teaches a nice moral lesson and is forgotten about. (Although there are some TV shows of higher quality, I really feel like Thomas the Tank Engine did a good job of showing many aspects of the human condition and I was reminded of this whole watching Bullet Train recently, no spoilers but if you\'ve seen it you know).\n\nTangent aside the reason this story has held up is because it conveys an important message. That message is that something may very well be a bad thing that poses a threat but if you claim everything is that threat eventually people get annoyed and stop listening, then one day it actually shows up but it\'s too late because nobody takes you seriously anymore.\n\nLooking back in history seriously it is clear to me that the view that sees history as ever marching forward to the progressive viewpoint, held back by bigots for a time but always marching forward, is not true. There have been radical and sudden cultural shifts toward culturally liberal values like we see today in the west but there has also been the opposite, look at the Middle East in the 60s to early 70s versus the four decades after that. I\'d argue that the Middle East is moving from religious fanaticism to a culturally conservative but less radical strong man style politics but it shows that the march of progressive values often reverses.\n\nMy point is there really are some scary elements on the fringes of the right and I think the arc of history makes it clear we are due for a right-wing backlash largely due to the fact that I think a lot of the urban elite have way less power than they have but act like they have more than they do and there\'s a growing distrust of all the institutions they are concentrated in and their ideology needs institutional support to function since it\'s so out of touch with human nature and the real world that in a vacuum it would lose. The question is to what? Hopefully a sane conservatism, but it might not be.\n\nThat being said when the people who are the true bigots who can actually get things done show up they won\'t be dumb enough to carry a swastika flag. It won\'t be "literally Handmaid\'s Tale" overnight but like boiling a frog things will become more and more extreme. Yet nobody will listen when the strong man really shows up because they accused everyone of being that, when in truth it will be somebody way more savvy than DeSantis, and way, way more than Trump.\n\nA good recent point of this is the George Santos think, it\'s pretty clear that Santos lied about his resume at this point. But he made the ok gesture on the floor of the House and again returned to the claim that this was a white power symbol. So here you have somebody who deserves legitimate criticism but they undermine that by making claims like this.')

Scott Herndon, R-Sagle, sought to change the state‚Äôs abortion laws, remove requirements for public works contractors to provide bathrooms that align with gender identity, and strengthen the state‚Äôs ‚ÄúStand Your Ground‚Äù laws; the one proposal of his that the Senate State Affairs Committee members did not vote to introduce would have removed rape and incest exemptions from Idaho‚Äôs abortion bans.\n\n\nSpeaking on Martin Luther King Jr. Day/Idaho Human Rights Day, Herndon equated his efforts to offer ‚Äúequal protection‚Äù under the law to fetuses to King‚Äôs civil rights efforts.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of auspicious that today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and he spent 13 years advancing the civil rights of people based on certain characteristics, and this does the same thing,‚Äù Herndon told the committee.\n\nMinority Leader Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, asked about situations in which teenage girls were raped by an uncle or father and if that girl would be forced to carry her pregnancy to term under Herndon‚Äôs proposed legislation.\n\nHerndon replied, ‚Äúsome people could describe the situation that you‚Äôre talking about as the opportunity to have the child under those terrible circumstances, if the rape actually occurred.‚Äù\n\nCurrently, the abortion ban includes an affirmative defense for abortions performed in cases of rape and incest if a police report is filed, but Herndon said that is merely an allegation that a rape or incest took place.\n\nThe committee voted to return the proposal to the senator rather than introducing it as a bill, with only Sen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, voting against it.\n\nSen. Treg Bernt, R-Meridian, told the Idaho Press he felt the proposed legislation went too far.\n\n‚ÄúThose exemptions are important and need to be respected under the law,‚Äù Bernt said.\n\nSens. Chuck Winder, R-Boise; Kelly Anthon, R-Burley; and Abby Lee, R-Fruitland, were absent.\n\nThe legislation Herndon did successfully introduce relating to abortion would add definitions of abortion and embryo or fetus. The proposal would amend the state‚Äôs trigger ban to say that embryo or fetus would, ‚Äúmean any human in utero‚Äù‚Äîwhich Herndon said would clarify that the criminal penalties for performing an abortion do not apply to treatment for an ectopic pregnancy, which is when the fetus develops outside of the uterus.\n\n\nThe bill would add the definition, ‚Äú‚ÄòAbortion‚Äô means the use or prescription of any instrument, medicine, drug, or other substance or device to intentionally kill a living embryo or fetus. ‚ÄòAbortion‚Äô shall not include the unintentional death of any human embryo or fetus.‚Äù\n\nHe said adding that the embryo or fetus is ‚Äúliving‚Äù and clarified that there would be no prosecution if an abortion was done when the fetus had miscarried.\n\nThe proposed bill adds that any person who provides care to a pregnant woman to save her life that results in the accidental death or injury to the fetus will not be prosecuted under the ban. Previously this only applied to healthcare professionals, but Herndon said he wanted to expand it to include all first responders.\n\nBernt said he would vote to introduce the legislation, ‚Äújust to do more research on it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI just need to learn more about it,‚Äù the freshman Senator told the Idaho Press. He said he‚Äôd want to reach out to healthcare professionals as he looked into this legislation and its potential effects.\n\nHerndon on Monday morning also brought forward legislation which, unless it‚Äôs required by federal law, states that public works contractors are not required to offer access to multiple-occupancy bathroom, changing room, or shower facilities to those whose gender identity is different from their biological sex.\n\nIn 2014, President Barack Obama signed an executive order banning federal contracts from discriminating on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. Herndon said that in projects in which federal funds are not used, the contracts do not have to include provisions that would allow people to use the bathrooms that align with their gender identity.\n\nWintrow asked Herndon, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm curious, how do we know somebody is transgender and how would we prohibit them from using a bathroom or shower facility?‚Äù\n\nHerndon said the bill only prohibits provisions in contracts and would not be determining if people are transgender.\n\nWintrow was the only committee member to vote against the introduction of the legislation.\n\n\nHerndon, in his fourth proposal of the day, sought to add to the state‚Äôs ‚ÄúStand Your Ground‚Äù laws, which allow for use of deadly force if someone is ‚Äúprotecting himself or his family by reasonable means necessary‚Äù and if they reasonably fear ‚Äúimminent peril of death or serious bodily injury,‚Äù the current law states.\n\nHerndon would like to add a section to the current statute that would allow for a pre-trial immunity hearing within 14 days if someone is arrested for use of force and they file a motion to dismiss on the basis of self-defense.\n\nTo overcome the immunity, prosecutors would have to prove ‚Äúby clear and convincing evidence,‚Äù which is an elevated standard of evidence.\n\nIf a case went to trial, and a jury found the defendant not guilty, there would be a separate question posed to the jury about whether the finding was based upon self-defense. If the jury answered yes, the judge could require the recovery of all of the defendant‚Äôs costs.\n\nWintrow voted to introduce the legislation but said she still had ‚Äúa lot of questions‚Äù about how it would affect law enforcement and court proceedings.\n\nThe legislation that was voted to be introduced will be assigned a bill number and then introduced by being read on the floor.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Idaho Press, read more on IdahoPress.com.')

The Mujahadeen was comprised of different groups from all over the world who later fought each other during the Afghan Civil War following the Soviet withdrawal. Osama bin Laden is the founder of AQ, and they were just one of the groups operating in Afghanistan after the war. \n\nGorbachev\'s request to get rid of Soviet nukes in exchange for America doing the same was made when the Soviets had zero leverage because of the impending collapse of the Soviet economy. By the time Gorbachev took power in 1985, 1 out of every 3 loaves of bread consumed in the USSR were imported. The problem for the Soviets was that the oil money they used to purchase foreign goods was gone by 1985. Why was it gone? Because the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan spooked the Saudis into aligning with the US and decreasing the price of oil. The goal of this collaboration was to choke the Soviet wallet and prevent the USSR from further aggression in the Muslim world. Facing a food crisis and no funds to import goods, Gorbachev needed to come to a deal with Reagan, and it was the Reagan administration that forced Gorbachev to grant political rights in the USSR. The offer to get rid of all nukes was just a publicity stunt that no one was interested in accepting. \n\nReagan wasn\'t perfect, but his handling of the USSR and using their own aggression against them was brilliant.

Drop the cost of admission substantially. The vast majority of med students (myself included) could not have supported ourselfs during admission. \n\nMy application cost around 8,000 dollars. Every school charges u a few hundred (probably 60ish% of applications will be automatically filtered before a human sees it, but only after you pay the cost). Then they send you a secondary app if you got the grades+mcat and charge u another 50-200 (again PER SCHOOL). Speaking of the mcat, thats another 300, unless you want to score well, then u need to pay 2000+ for a prep course. Then there are a bunch of bullshit personality tests that cost 150-250 that only an idiot would answer honestly on. Most schools required 1-2 of these, i paid for 2 (350 for my year). A conservative applicant (like myself) applied to 18 schools, but most neurotic premeds apply to 50+, more than doubling this cost. After all of this, assuming you have the grades, you still have only about a 40% chance of acceptance. Most applicants these days need a gap year, so if they applied and failed double the cost. Its not unreasonable to spend 20k getting into medical school, all while requiring us to have degrees that can only get u minimum wage jobs. How the fuck can someone without rich parents do that? \n\nThere is a point when you are qualified for medical school. Then theres the point where u can be accepted into medical school. Id estimate 75ish% of the applicant pool each year can handle the academic stress. 40% are admitted. \n\nWe are not accepting the best people who will be good doctors, we are selecting the most competitive humans alive and then expecting them to magically become extra good compassionate people after shoving them in a room to study for 12 hours a day every day for 2 years.

We can‚Äôt measure that directly, so we use things like grades standardized tests. But these scores and tests can be gamed, especially if you have resources. \n\nWhich would you rather admit? The guy who scored a 1350 on his SAT but took a prep course that guarantees a 100+ point improvement?

Bad meme.\n\nhttps://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/01/16/idaho-senate-committee-advances-bill-that-would-change-legal-definition-of-abortion/\n\n"Wintrow asked Herndon if the bill would force a hypothetical 13-year-old girl who was raped by a male family member to carry the child to term. Herndon said the state of Idaho has nothing to do with forcing anyone to carry a child and those are merely natural circumstances.\n\n‚ÄúSome people could describe the situation that you‚Äôre talking about as the opportunity to have a child in those terrible circumstances if the rape actually occurred,‚Äù Herndon told Wintrow. He told the story of a person in Montana who wrote a book about how her stepfather raped her and forced her to have an abortion the first time she was pregnant and the second time she had the child.\n\n‚ÄúThat child that she actually had proved to be incredibly cathartic for her and a huge blessing in her life,‚Äù he said."\n\n\n\nSo a huge miss-characterisation of what he said. \n\nAdd on to that he was making an attempt to clear the grey lines for when an abortion is allowed under the current legislation:\n\n"The change would ensure health care professionals would not face prosecution or other legal consequences for handling certain common complications during pregnancy, Herndon said. It would clarify that the Legislature‚Äôs interest is in the living child,\xa0he said.\n\n‚ÄúI have run this by several in our medical community, this language has been reviewed by a number of pro-life physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists and they agree that this offers some clarity for them as to legitimate medical practice,‚Äù Herndon said...\n\nSen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, said the bill is a ‚Äúgreat solution to a real issue‚Äù and thanked Herndon for sponsoring it.\n\n‚ÄúI have doctors in our community that I know have expressed concern that they could be working to save the life of a mother and there could be an issue where they would feel like they were stuck between a rock and a hard place,‚Äù Toews said. ‚ÄúThis type of legislation is what we need to address that situation.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSo far from saying that incestual rape was cathartic he was referencing a case where a mother said having the baby was cathartic for her, her words, not his.\n\nAND he was trying to make it *easier for doctors to perform abortions in cases where it would be admissible*\n\nLeftists shooting themselves in the foot with this lazy propaganda.')

We do have a subreddit called Children of Dusk, if you want to check out more of this world, google it.\n\nLore Sample:\n\nEconomic Collapse, 2 World Wars, 2 Religious Revolutions, the Rise of the Global South, and the establishment of an extremely multipolar world order.\n\nEach individual region has mountains of lore, just for an example. Fatalist Germany is a country controlled by a superintelligent AI, but it's hardware has been degrading over time, and it's superiority over humans has been shrinking as artificial intelligence turned out to hit a wall of diminishing returns, and humanity has now built other technology that can counter it. By the year 2100, what used to be the haunting specter of the world has been reduced to a rump state, increasingly reliant on their allies in a Technocratic France to support itself.\n\nIn the East African Federation, a council of benevolent corporations took power, stepping in after the failure of their governments in the floods and nuclear winter of World War 4, radically restructuring society around the corporation. Originally exploiting the economy for profit, these CEOs have now drunk their own propaganda so much that they genuinely do believe they are a series of benevolent despots, leading the world to a new world order. Think of every what every modern corporation tries to present, thinking they're going to save the world, but now they believe that unironically.\n\nSurveillance cameras dot every street, and familial relationships are banned, because the company is your family, everyone is your family, and you wouldn't want to let your family down, would you? In the Islamic World, the failure of the 3rd Arab-Israeli War sparked a radical shift in the culture of Islam, people became convinced that Islam had fallen behind, and only by modernizing can the religion compete with its older brother, Christianity, which by now was going through a reawakening. The Islamic Culture Wars saw the conflict between Islamic modernity and traditionalists wage out, with new movements like Quranism taking over Turkey.\n\nIn America, an economic crash, and rising polarization saw a confrontation between the center-left and the far right (In America center-left is far left honestly.) leading to the victory of Victoria Cortez, a Christian nationalist who radically restructured the nation in her image in preparation for a fight against the Eurasians and Chinese, who at the time controlled the world. The eventual confrontation led to billions of deaths, and 15% of America's population specifically being wiped out. With the ash clearing, did the American eagle finally begin to recover. Under the progressive administration of Alisha Crowder, and later on, Julia Land, the US eventually transitioned back into a semi-liberal democracy, though marks of its Christian Nationalist era remains.\n\nIt is worth noting here that Alisha Crowder later greatly radicalized later in life, moving to Cuba, joining the Solarpunk movement, and then becoming the first ex-American president to assassinate another ex-American president, ironically she assassinated Julia Land, the first Asian president of the US. This has very little to do with everything else I just wanted to mention it this timeline is insane.\n\nFinally, in the year 2092, Bernie Sanders, beyond all odds somehow takes the presidency, now being over 100 years old. After being in office for precisely 23 days, he passes free healthcare, then has a stroke and dies on the Resolute Table right after he signed it into law, his life purpose being complete.\n\nIf you really want to see the sheer autism of this timeline there's a full Google doc here. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9ELHr5oiN2XjczQfhiljoGPQxCFgHGR1AnLlokJoEs/edit?usp=sharing\n\nIf you have any further questions about the lore, reply to this post and I'll answer any questions you may have.")

(Although there are some TV shows of higher quality, I really feel like Thomas the Tank Engine did a good job of showing many aspects of the human condition and I was reminded of this whole watching Bullet Train recently, no spoilers but if you\'ve seen it you know).\n\nTangent aside the reason this story has held up is because it conveys an important message. That message is that something may very well be a bad thing that poses a threat but if you claim everything is that threat eventually people get annoyed and stop listening, then one day it actually shows up but it\'s too late because nobody takes you seriously anymore.\n\nLooking back in history seriously it is clear to me that the view that sees history as ever marching forward to the progressive viewpoint, held back by bigots for a time but always marching forward, is not true. There have been radical and sudden cultural shifts toward culturally liberal values like we see today in the west but there has also been the opposite, look at the Middle East in the 60s to early 70s versus the four decades after that. I\'d argue that the Middle East is moving from religious fanaticism to a culturally conservative but less radical strong man style politics but it shows that the march of progressive values often reverses.\n\nMy point is there really are some scary elements on the fringes of the right and I think the arc of history makes it clear we are due for a right-wing backlash largely due to the fact that I think a lot of the urban elite have way less power than they have but act like they have more than they do and there\'s a growing distrust of all the institutions they are concentrated in and their ideology needs institutional support to function since it\'s so out of touch with human nature and the real world that in a vacuum it would lose. The question is to what? Hopefully a sane conservatism, but it might not be.\n\nThat being said when the people who are the true bigots who can actually get things done show up they won\'t be dumb enough to carry a swastika flag. It won\'t be "literally Handmaid\'s Tale" overnight but like boiling a frog things will become more and more extreme. Yet nobody will listen when the strong man really shows up because they accused everyone of being that, when in truth it will be somebody way more savvy than DeSantis, and way, way more than Trump.\n\nA good recent point of this is the George Santos think, it\'s pretty clear that Santos lied about his resume at this point. But he made the ok gesture on the floor of the House and again returned to the claim that this was a white power symbol. So here you have somebody who deserves legitimate criticism but they undermine that by making claims like this.')

Scott Herndon, R-Sagle, sought to change the state‚Äôs abortion laws, remove requirements for public works contractors to provide bathrooms that align with gender identity, and strengthen the state‚Äôs ‚ÄúStand Your Ground‚Äù laws; the one proposal of his that the Senate State Affairs Committee members did not vote to introduce would have removed rape and incest exemptions from Idaho‚Äôs abortion bans.\n\n\nSpeaking on Martin Luther King Jr. Day/Idaho Human Rights Day, Herndon equated his efforts to offer ‚Äúequal protection‚Äù under the law to fetuses to King‚Äôs civil rights efforts.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of auspicious that today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and he spent 13 years advancing the civil rights of people based on certain characteristics, and this does the same thing,‚Äù Herndon told the committee.\n\nMinority Leader Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, asked about situations in which teenage girls were raped by an uncle or father and if that girl would be forced to carry her pregnancy to term under Herndon‚Äôs proposed legislation.\n\nHerndon replied, ‚Äúsome people could describe the situation that you‚Äôre talking about as the opportunity to have the child under those terrible circumstances, if the rape actually occurred.‚Äù\n\nCurrently, the abortion ban includes an affirmative defense for abortions performed in cases of rape and incest if a police report is filed, but Herndon said that is merely an allegation that a rape or incest took place.\n\nThe committee voted to return the proposal to the senator rather than introducing it as a bill, with only Sen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, voting against it.\n\nSen. Treg Bernt, R-Meridian, told the Idaho Press he felt the proposed legislation went too far.\n\n‚ÄúThose exemptions are important and need to be respected under the law,‚Äù Bernt said.\n\nSens. Chuck Winder, R-Boise; Kelly Anthon, R-Burley; and Abby Lee, R-Fruitland, were absent.\n\nThe legislation Herndon did successfully introduce relating to abortion would add definitions of abortion and embryo or fetus. The proposal would amend the state‚Äôs trigger ban to say that embryo or fetus would, ‚Äúmean any human in utero‚Äù‚Äîwhich Herndon said would clarify that the criminal penalties for performing an abortion do not apply to treatment for an ectopic pregnancy, which is when the fetus develops outside of the uterus.\n\n\nThe bill would add the definition, ‚Äú‚ÄòAbortion‚Äô means the use or prescription of any instrument, medicine, drug, or other substance or device to intentionally kill a living embryo or fetus. ‚ÄòAbortion‚Äô shall not include the unintentional death of any human embryo or fetus.‚Äù\n\nHe said adding that the embryo or fetus is ‚Äúliving‚Äù and clarified that there would be no prosecution if an abortion was done when the fetus had miscarried.\n\nThe proposed bill adds that any person who provides care to a pregnant woman to save her life that results in the accidental death or injury to the fetus will not be prosecuted under the ban. Previously this only applied to healthcare professionals, but Herndon said he wanted to expand it to include all first responders.\n\nBernt said he would vote to introduce the legislation, ‚Äújust to do more research on it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI just need to learn more about it,‚Äù the freshman Senator told the Idaho Press. He said he‚Äôd want to reach out to healthcare professionals as he looked into this legislation and its potential effects.\n\nHerndon on Monday morning also brought forward legislation which, unless it‚Äôs required by federal law, states that public works contractors are not required to offer access to multiple-occupancy bathroom, changing room, or shower facilities to those whose gender identity is different from their biological sex.\n\nIn 2014, President Barack Obama signed an executive order banning federal contracts from discriminating on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. Herndon said that in projects in which federal funds are not used, the contracts do not have to include provisions that would allow people to use the bathrooms that align with their gender identity.\n\nWintrow asked Herndon, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm curious, how do we know somebody is transgender and how would we prohibit them from using a bathroom or shower facility?‚Äù\n\nHerndon said the bill only prohibits provisions in contracts and would not be determining if people are transgender.\n\nWintrow was the only committee member to vote against the introduction of the legislation.\n\n\nHerndon, in his fourth proposal of the day, sought to add to the state‚Äôs ‚ÄúStand Your Ground‚Äù laws, which allow for use of deadly force if someone is ‚Äúprotecting himself or his family by reasonable means necessary‚Äù and if they reasonably fear ‚Äúimminent peril of death or serious bodily injury,‚Äù the current law states.\n\nHerndon would like to add a section to the current statute that would allow for a pre-trial immunity hearing within 14 days if someone is arrested for use of force and they file a motion to dismiss on the basis of self-defense.\n\nTo overcome the immunity, prosecutors would have to prove ‚Äúby clear and convincing evidence,‚Äù which is an elevated standard of evidence.\n\nIf a case went to trial, and a jury found the defendant not guilty, there would be a separate question posed to the jury about whether the finding was based upon self-defense. If the jury answered yes, the judge could require the recovery of all of the defendant‚Äôs costs.\n\nWintrow voted to introduce the legislation but said she still had ‚Äúa lot of questions‚Äù about how it would affect law enforcement and court proceedings.\n\nThe legislation that was voted to be introduced will be assigned a bill number and then introduced by being read on the floor.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Idaho Press, read more on IdahoPress.com.')

Osama bin Laden is the founder of AQ, and they were just one of the groups operating in Afghanistan after the war. \n\nGorbachev\'s request to get rid of Soviet nukes in exchange for America doing the same was made when the Soviets had zero leverage because of the impending collapse of the Soviet economy. By the time Gorbachev took power in 1985, 1 out of every 3 loaves of bread consumed in the USSR were imported. The problem for the Soviets was that the oil money they used to purchase foreign goods was gone by 1985. Why was it gone? Because the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan spooked the Saudis into aligning with the US and decreasing the price of oil. The goal of this collaboration was to choke the Soviet wallet and prevent the USSR from further aggression in the Muslim world. Facing a food crisis and no funds to import goods, Gorbachev needed to come to a deal with Reagan, and it was the Reagan administration that forced Gorbachev to grant political rights in the USSR. The offer to get rid of all nukes was just a publicity stunt that no one was interested in accepting. \n\nReagan wasn\'t perfect, but his handling of the USSR and using their own aggression against them was brilliant.

Drop the cost of admission substantially. The vast majority of med students (myself included) could not have supported ourselfs during admission. \n\nMy application cost around 8,000 dollars. Every school charges u a few hundred (probably 60ish% of applications will be automatically filtered before a human sees it, but only after you pay the cost). Then they send you a secondary app if you got the grades+mcat and charge u another 50-200 (again PER SCHOOL). Speaking of the mcat, thats another 300, unless you want to score well, then u need to pay 2000+ for a prep course. Then there are a bunch of bullshit personality tests that cost 150-250 that only an idiot would answer honestly on. Most schools required 1-2 of these, i paid for 2 (350 for my year). A conservative applicant (like myself) applied to 18 schools, but most neurotic premeds apply to 50+, more than doubling this cost. After all of this, assuming you have the grades, you still have only about a 40% chance of acceptance. Most applicants these days need a gap year, so if they applied and failed double the cost. Its not unreasonable to spend 20k getting into medical school, all while requiring us to have degrees that can only get u minimum wage jobs. How the fuck can someone without rich parents do that? \n\nThere is a point when you are qualified for medical school. Then theres the point where u can be accepted into medical school. Id estimate 75ish% of the applicant pool each year can handle the academic stress. 40% are admitted. \n\nWe are not accepting the best people who will be good doctors, we are selecting the most competitive humans alive and then expecting them to magically become extra good compassionate people after shoving them in a room to study for 12 hours a day every day for 2 years.

We can‚Äôt measure that directly, so we use things like grades standardized tests. But these scores and tests can be gamed, especially if you have resources. \n\nWhich would you rather admit?

Bad meme.\n\nhttps://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/01/16/idaho-senate-committee-advances-bill-that-would-change-legal-definition-of-abortion/\n\n"Wintrow asked Herndon if the bill would force a hypothetical 13-year-old girl who was raped by a male family member to carry the child to term. Herndon said the state of Idaho has nothing to do with forcing anyone to carry a child and those are merely natural circumstances.\n\n‚ÄúSome people could describe the situation that you‚Äôre talking about as the opportunity to have a child in those terrible circumstances if the rape actually occurred,‚Äù Herndon told Wintrow. He told the story of a person in Montana who wrote a book about how her stepfather raped her and forced her to have an abortion the first time she was pregnant and the second time she had the child.\n\n‚ÄúThat child that she actually had proved to be incredibly cathartic for her and a huge blessing in her life,‚Äù he said."\n\n\n\nSo a huge miss-characterisation of what he said. \n\nAdd on to that he was making an attempt to clear the grey lines for when an abortion is allowed under the current legislation:\n\n"The change would ensure health care professionals would not face prosecution or other legal consequences for handling certain common complications during pregnancy, Herndon said. It would clarify that the Legislature‚Äôs interest is in the living child,\xa0he said.\n\n‚ÄúI have run this by several in our medical community, this language has been reviewed by a number of pro-life physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists and they agree that this offers some clarity for them as to legitimate medical practice,‚Äù Herndon said...\n\nSen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, said the bill is a ‚Äúgreat solution to a real issue‚Äù and thanked Herndon for sponsoring it.\n\n‚ÄúI have doctors in our community that I know have expressed concern that they could be working to save the life of a mother and there could be an issue where they would feel like they were stuck between a rock and a hard place,‚Äù Toews said. ‚ÄúThis type of legislation is what we need to address that situation.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSo far from saying that incestual rape was cathartic he was referencing a case where a mother said having the baby was cathartic for her, her words, not his.\n\nAND he was trying to make it *easier for doctors to perform abortions in cases where it would be admissible*\n\nLeftists shooting themselves in the foot with this lazy propaganda.')

We do have a subreddit called Children of Dusk, if you want to check out more of this world, google it.\n\nLore Sample:\n\nEconomic Collapse, 2 World Wars, 2 Religious Revolutions, the Rise of the Global South, and the establishment of an extremely multipolar world order.\n\nEach individual region has mountains of lore, just for an example. Fatalist Germany is a country controlled by a superintelligent AI, but it's hardware has been degrading over time, and it's superiority over humans has been shrinking as artificial intelligence turned out to hit a wall of diminishing returns, and humanity has now built other technology that can counter it. By the year 2100, what used to be the haunting specter of the world has been reduced to a rump state, increasingly reliant on their allies in a Technocratic France to support itself.\n\nIn the East African Federation, a council of benevolent corporations took power, stepping in after the failure of their governments in the floods and nuclear winter of World War 4, radically restructuring society around the corporation. Originally exploiting the economy for profit, these CEOs have now drunk their own propaganda so much that they genuinely do believe they are a series of benevolent despots, leading the world to a new world order. Think of every what every modern corporation tries to present, thinking they're going to save the world, but now they believe that unironically.\n\nSurveillance cameras dot every street, and familial relationships are banned, because the company is your family, everyone is your family, and you wouldn't want to let your family down, would you? In the Islamic World, the failure of the 3rd Arab-Israeli War sparked a radical shift in the culture of Islam, people became convinced that Islam had fallen behind, and only by modernizing can the religion compete with its older brother, Christianity, which by now was going through a reawakening. The Islamic Culture Wars saw the conflict between Islamic modernity and traditionalists wage out, with new movements like Quranism taking over Turkey.\n\nIn America, an economic crash, and rising polarization saw a confrontation between the center-left and the far right (In America center-left is far left honestly.) leading to the victory of Victoria Cortez, a Christian nationalist who radically restructured the nation in her image in preparation for a fight against the Eurasians and Chinese, who at the time controlled the world. The eventual confrontation led to billions of deaths, and 15% of America's population specifically being wiped out. With the ash clearing, did the American eagle finally begin to recover. Under the progressive administration of Alisha Crowder, and later on, Julia Land, the US eventually transitioned back into a semi-liberal democracy, though marks of its Christian Nationalist era remains.\n\nIt is worth noting here that Alisha Crowder later greatly radicalized later in life, moving to Cuba, joining the Solarpunk movement, and then becoming the first ex-American president to assassinate another ex-American president, ironically she assassinated Julia Land, the first Asian president of the US. This has very little to do with everything else I just wanted to mention it this timeline is insane.\n\nFinally, in the year 2092, Bernie Sanders, beyond all odds somehow takes the presidency, now being over 100 years old. After being in office for precisely 23 days, he passes free healthcare, then has a stroke and dies on the Resolute Table right after he signed it into law, his life purpose being complete.\n\nIf you really want to see the sheer autism of this timeline there's a full Google doc here. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9ELHr5oiN2XjczQfhiljoGPQxCFgHGR1AnLlokJoEs/edit?usp=sharing\n\nIf you have any further questions about the lore, reply to this post and I'll answer any questions you may have.")
