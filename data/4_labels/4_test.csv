Wow cool\n\nLet me know in about 2 months when the EU comes crying to us for LNG because they were too short sighted and delusional to think that maybe Russia isn’t always aligned with them\n\nEuropeans and hopefully some progressives over here will get a hard reality check in the next 6 months. I saw a post of a lady in Ireland with a Ukraine flag on her profile complaining about electricity prices. And that was in late August wait until January,1

Euros would love to vacation to the US and complain about everything. Now that your currency is dog shit us Americans will be flying over there by the C-17 to kick our feet up and piss in your alleys.,1
"Forcing firms to have paid vacations is a pretty stupid concept. It only means that your pay for the work you do around the year is spread out during the vacation period. \n\nWhat if you don't want to have vacations but work harder to make more money? You can't.",1

Don’t you dirty delete this. \n\nStay and take your medicine.,1
Leftist flair not spreading misinformation for sake of narrative challenge (impossible),1
"In my country 41 cops died during service in the last 22 years. More than 80% of them died due to some sort of accident (usually a car crash).\n\nIn the US about 3500 cops died in the same time frame. I imagine the accident percentage is much lower too.\n\nMy country is 32 times less populous than the US but I think it draws a good picture anyway. Also keep in mind that every civilian in the US has a chance of having a gun on him as there are more guns than people. You guys don't appreciate your cops enough lol.",0
He shot at them asshole.,1
"If someone shoots a fucking gun at me i'm shooting them in the back as they run away unarmed.\n\nIDGAF I was eliminating the threat",1
The black community needs to adopt belts or something,1
Is there a case of a white mass shooter that fired at the police and the police didn’t kill him and tried to somehow nonlethally take him down?,3
Jayland Walker failed to pull over and infact forced the officers into a pursuit. Walker had a ski mask on and ran towards the parking lot. This sounds like the sketchiest guy ever no wonder he got shot 60 times. Are you really defending this kind of character?,3
"I've never seen something more wrong in my life!\n\nHate all these damn lies that the left are telling",1
60 times is fucking insane but you do have to take context into the matter he was initially armed and then disarmed himself.pulling up your pants in the dead of night looks like it about to pull a gun from a waistband to be fair,2
Wut??,3
Jayland walker was armed silly goose,1
Police suck. The reason people defend them is dumb fucks like you who never let the facts get in the way of your shitty narrative.,1
It was a shitty situation. Really seems like a suicide by cop to me.,1
"pulling up his pants"\n\nHE DINDU NUFFIN,3
Am I…am I supposed to disagree here?,1
"Don't let anyone know he had a gun while speeding away from police and shot a bullet from his car. That would be devastating to your case.",1
His name is fucking Salvador and you think he’s white?,3
He literally shot at the cops,1

Congrats on being the most controversial post on this sub of all time I guess.,1

At least you tagged it as an agenda post. Partial based points for that,1
Dont know what to tell you bud but the last time they didnt shoot a mass shooter he was hispanic. Not white,3
Ben Shapiro true allegiance kid,0
"police later found a gun in the suspects car"\n*The gun was unloaded no bullet in the chamber with the magazine full next to it*\nYea bro for sure I\'ll trust the police they never lied (Never forget Uvalde).,0

As Spez overlooked his kingdom an LGBTQ+ flag fluttering proudly in the wind above he observed the once proud army of auth rights solemnly march away having been stripped of their spirit and identity. He then turned to his P.O.C subjects stopping momentarily to glance at his Chinese overlords. He spoke "The decree has made it so. Racism is no more in the lands of Reddit." Lib left cheered as auth left nodded with approval. But where was lib right you may ask? They worked in the shadows completing black market weapon deals with auth right encouraging them to not go quiet into that goodnight. N word bombs rang out in the distance auth right wouldn\'t go silently.,1

I used to watch Crowder and skip to the parts with Dave Landau. Dude’s hilarious,2
This is proof that this sub is fucking insane,2
The man who actively advocates for workers rights and equality for everyone and the deeply racist queerphobic and sexist anti masker are equally bad?,0
Based and grifters-gonna-grift pilled,0
Also same gender,1
… but hasan has great takes and is right most of the time and provides tons of sources. \n\ncrowder is just a racist asshole who thinks he’s funny and pays a bunch of even more racist people to pretend to be his friends.,0
Crowder is better at his job. I guess it’s the closest you can get to a one to one on stupid streamers. Shapiro in terms of format is closer to Piker but comes off as less stupid. Crowder is probably on par with that.,1
"Crowder is much better than Hassan just because he actually does research. Of course he's biased and sometimes trashy but he's clearly better than Hassan.",0
Bruh. This take is pure garbage. Hasan is based. How the fuck is he even anywhat like Matt Walsh? I bet a Vaushite made this.,2
You know this sub is shit when people are calling Crowder a good journalist. Lmao i expect and agree with some of the Hasan criticism but y\'all are literally simping for the cringiest rw guy who got famous for "debating" unprepared college students while he has still not even ever debated any prominent left wing youtuber.\n At least Hasan has the balls to own his position and go on interviews and debates however flawed they might be. Cannot believe people believe in such a bitch as Crowder,0
Can’t both are fucking morons,0
I don’t like Crowder but putting him on the same level as Hasan is beyond insulting. Even Crowder looks like Einstein in comparison.,1

They’re practically the same Hasan is just a capitalist who thinks he’s a socialist and has socialist ideas but hates capitalism while reacting to videos that are very well made and take a long time to make so he can profit off of them and then defends this by saying that the other profits in exposure when you draw more views away from the original creator. Not very socialist of him.,0

Wow the two least funny individuals on the face of the planet,0
I mean one said 9/11 was a good thing,1
Circular logic. Ignored.,1
It\'s the stupidest definition ever. How do you identify as something that has no external definition? \n\n"I identify as Zquealliphirmotax. What is Zqueallirphirmotax you ask? It\'s what I identify as. Duh.",1
A woman is someone who identifies as a woman is someone who identifies as a woman is someone who identifies as a woman is someone who identifies as a woman. \n\nAnd round and round we go,1
I identify as a dragon pay for my wing implants or ur a bigot,1
"*Ha! The joke is that auth-right doesn't know what a woman is.*\n\n**WAIT A MINUTE!**",3
That\'s not a definition!\n\nThen "women" are identifying as what?,2
common libleft L,1
Does that make the word “woman” an onomatopoeia?,1
Based libleft. Although you would need to specify that "identify as" would have to mean that they actually do identify as a womam rather than them just saying it.,1
I identify as a person who identifies as a person who identifies as a person who identifies as a person who identifies as a…,1
they all get the gulag one way or another,2
There are some ideas that are just so god damned stupid that they shouldn’t even be engaged with beyond flippant mocking dismissal. \n\n“Gender abolitionism” is one of those.,3
but does that mean if Arnold Schwarzenegger says he is a woman but for the rest does nothing to change his appereance or mannerism. that he is a woman and can use the womans restroom and stuff?,3
Sorry OP the title ruined it for me.,0
that\'s why they go ape-shit crazy online with the ban hammer when people misgender them in real life they keep quiet. they don\'t care about their "human rights" they just want to bully people online because they get bullied in real life. it\'s all just a revenge game if they cared about human rights and all the other shit they complain we are violating with our memes and comments then they would be standing in front of Congress every day asking to have their rights recognized etc. None of that happens it\'s just a bunch of control freaks running internet websites for free. Literally get a life lol,1

Being overly political in a relationship is a huge red flag.,2
"Guys who say women won't date them because of their political beliefs are probably just unattractive honestly/socially inept. Especially if you're on the right.\n\nConservative women like Conservative men and left wing women like to be told they're wrong by a father figure because they have daddy issues. If you're over 6 foot right wing and reasonably attractive you should be able to pull no problem. Just don't make it your whole personality.",3

I actually thought the meme was kinda funny as political disagreement is a fair reason not to date someone. Then you turn out to be unflaired.,1
Freedom of association. One of my many favourite freedoms,1
Legitimately is. Don’t date someone if your values don’t align and you can’t come to an agreement on the core issues. If that means not dating conservatives then that’s what it means. Better for both you and them.,3
So I can call trans women homies?,3
"Good bait I almost got angry from this post\n\nThen I remembered that Hitler is cringe and I don't want to associate with him anyway",3
"ohh sweaty calling trans person homies is problematic and you're cancelled for this",1
"I'll take trans over Hitler but I wish that the trans community grew some fucking balls (no pun intended) and stopped being so thin skinned.\nYou do not need fictional characters to reassure you about your identity.",1
Glad to see that he does indeed identify himself as the Problem seems he can learn after all.,3
"anyone who doesn't respect trans people is literally Hitler and you're going to beat them up?? lol hope you can build up a win streak and go box Jake Paul later next summer then",1
A man who works out beats on people and has he/him tattooed on this arm would just get called toxically masculine,2

"That is what happens when you destroy everything Conservatives and Nationalists cherish and tell them that they should shut up or they'll lose their job.",3
"Fascism is when I don't like something.",1
What do you think fascism is?,1
"Well the economy has been unstable since 2020 and there has been a loud left wing movement. Crisis generally make people sway towards authoritarianism. But during the last two and a half years the conservatives have been the loudest voices against the insanely autocratic covid policies which was the complete opposite of what I at least would've predicted.",1
Fascism this fascism that …… \n\nBoth right and left wing pundits would gladly become authoritative given the chance the “b-but he’s a fascist!” boogeyman is irrelevant. \n\nAuthoritarianism exists on both sides of the spectrum it’s way past time that people started acknowledging their own biases that would contribute to authoritarianism.,1
This gives real "everything I don\'t like is fascism" vibes  \n\n\nThat aside democracy was dumb to begin with so who cares??,1
"Wait isn't fascism left wing? I'm pretty sure it started with a socialist movement and Hitler wanted to kill the jews because they owned everything. Collectivism and nationalizations don't sound like right wing to me",1
Funny in our current political climate we see authleft ogling fascism. I smell a libleft larping as centrist.,0

Frankly I don’t really care,1
Who gives a shit?,1
I\'m an Indian and literally really no one cares. All the cringe leftists celebrating her death don\'t make any sense. She died at 96 already after doing whatever you have accused her off you didn\'t have the balls to kill her while she apparently she was doing whatever you claim she has done. One day your favorite leaders will also die and you\'ll also die at some age. And idk much about how uk works tbh but i think its the prime ministers like Churchill who did more shit than her. This is like you celebrating your pathetic soy son celebrating your high school bully\'s death even though her life was much better and happier than yours and your son\'s you can see it\'s kinda pathetic and wannabe. Also the cringesters who are "mourning" Her death from these countries well they\'re just stupid. Also the fact that your own countries are ruled by corrupt leaders who are destroying it day by day and your only cope is that some Monarch died many Kms away,0
A lot of uk people are also happy she died,0

Obviously chromosome pattern isn\'t the end all be all to sex if changing the dominant sex hormone does so much alone. \n\nPlus when I meet these people and stand there like "this is why you\'re wrong" without getting angry or anything they start to avoid me at all costs...

"The world would be better if we lived in a society where lactating women could get jobs selling their breast milk as an alternative to cow milk. Just think about it human breast milk is healthier for humans than cows milk and we could reduce the amount of cows in factory farms; reduce the amount of cows in general which would reduce the amount of methane going into the atmosphere and have less of an affect on climate change. Women could unionize to have good working conditions with decent pay and benefits which would actually make the milk taste better if they were under less stress. Although it will be mandatory to be drug free and maybe have regular drug tests to insure the quality of milk that might actually motivate struggling women to quit drugs and get off the streets by selling breast milk. Women with hyperlactation would have an outlet for their excess milk production and be compensated for all the milk they sell while women who under produce could easily buy the amount of breast milk they need from the grocery store. Just imagine having an omelet cheesy pasta or chocolate milk but made with human breast milk; that would be pretty wild by todays standards. The only downside is that drinking breast milk would be normalized and no one would masturbate to the idea of drinking from lactating titties because that is indeed a problem and everyone totally masturbates to lactating titties. Don't turn this into a copy pasta or I will ejaculate into your nightmares; I am like Freddy Krueger but horny and I would totally fill your dreams with spermy wormies.",1
My boy can women not enjoy what they want?,0
Most people find dating to be hard. We tend to look at the people who are succeeding and assume that everyone else knows what they\'re doing and we\'re the only ones that are struggling and when that is too much to stomach it\'s tempting to believe that we aren\'t fitting in because everyone else is crazy. I think almost everyone goes through a phase like that. \n\nBut the people that seem to be thriving never have it as good as we think they do. It sucks being alone it also sucks being so afraid being alone that you stay with people who treat you like shit. It sucks to feel like you are out of place everywhere you go it also sucks to be so reliant on others to distract you or give you a sense of identity that you would say or do whatever it takes to keep their approval only to lose it anyway because people are never as predictable as we\'d like them to be.\n\nThe good and bad news is that life doesn\'t stay paused while you try to figure all this stuff out. There are books to read prayers to pray tasks both fruitful and senseless to overcome if only you can bring yourself to pick up the plow and do them and it isn\'t always easy.\n\nThe problem with MGTOW types is they view taking control of their own lives as grabbing their ball and going home but it\'s always been your job to build a fulfilling life regardless of other people\'s choices and you aren\'t going to find that getting mad at "Stacies" or whatever,1
 Jesse we need to cook. There’s no time to be making incel memes on reddit,1

Quite frankly I don’t think there are a whole lot of women(or men) who find that word salad you wrote interesting and it’s not their job to find it interesting; it’s *your* job to *be* interesting. That’s just the way the game is played and if you wanna talk about such niche stuff you have to be prepared for the fact that not a whole lot of people(and even less people that you want to fuck) will find it interesting.,3

But why are you wheat in all systems?,1
I get the sexual orientation thingie but the "gender" thing was single-handedly made up by a literal pedophile who even lied about results of his experiments to prove his point. Quote from wiki -   \n\n\n>If I were to see the case of a boy aged ten or eleven who\'s intensely erotically attracted toward a man in his twenties or thirties if the relationship is totally mutual and the bonding is genuinely totally mutual \\[...\\] then I would not call it pathological in any way\n\nIf anything gender sounds like a modern phlogiston - a speculation popularized for it\'s relation to social changes and surviving by sheer virtue of being miles away from actual science(and i mean STEM).,2
To 3rd graders?,1
Here’s the thing: why should teachers teach kids about these things during or before 3rd grade? That’s the kind of thing parents can cover if they so choose. Teachers should not be teaching kids about gender identity or sexuality especially without parents knowing.\n\nAnd I hope you know the only reason this bill is going through at all is because teachers were grooming kids into being LGBT or joining LGBT clubs without parents knowing.,1

"I have better stuff to do when arguing. First of all my purple libright argument:\n\nTrans genitalia (idk how you call it) do not work as sexually intended. It becomes less sensitive to pleasure. \n\nNow my do-the-maths argument:\nThe process of genitalia mutilation/change takes a lot of time because the tissue wants to grow back. If you open a wound on your arm it'll regenerate if you lose your penis and get a hole in its place the tissue tries to regenerate as well and as a consequence the patient stays weeks (and even months) using a device that *pushes back the tissue*. The whole process is too expensive and time-consuming taking hospital beds so it should only be done by private healthcare (if done at all).\n\nMy free-will argument:\nDo you know the ammount of trans people who *pretend to not be trans and have sex with others without telling them?* Everyone should have the right to know the biological physical and auto-determined sexes of the individual they're dating or having intercouse with.\n\n\nAll the before-mentioned arguments have been formulated considering true stories I know from doctors who had to perform trans surgery during their study in order to get the diploma. \nFinally the argument I won't discuss with anyone because all it will bring is chaos and I won't really change your opinion. So don't try to debunk it.\nI believe Freud's explanation to sexual behaviour to be the best one. Naturally the person is considered heterossexual. Because of experiences and convivence the individual can tend to identify with other genders/sexual preferences/idk what else. This translates to people *not being born LGBT*.",3

Do we talk about not wanting to fuck trans people is labeled as “transphobic”?\n\nDo we talk about navigating the labyrinth of pronouns? (Person looks sounds and acts like a woman.

(Tries to cancel Dave Chappelle for his jokes despite him not saying anything bad about trans people)\n\nOr are we just gonna pretend none of this is going on because it makes trans people look bad?,1

This straw man can be spun either way. \n\nJust say you don’t care about women.,0
You’re just as bad as the people who think you just want to “oppress women” when you ban abortions. \n\nThis is a complicated philosophical question. Where does a life begin? Does that life’s autonomy breach that of the mother’s autonomy? Should the state make that decision?  When does consciousness begin? What the fuck even is consciousness? We don’t know the answer to these questions. \n\nThere is no objective answer. My stance is entirely subjective as is yours.,0

I wish life and liberty would be an unalienable right.\nBut guess what?

The pro-life side often tends to ignore the struggles of the pregnant woman.\n\nThe pro-choice side often tends to ignore the 50% of us women who are actually pro-life / who have regretted their abortion.\n\nCall me a filthy centrist Nazi but there needs to be a middle ground where we can learn from and understand each other better \n\nThat being said to spread the idea that abortion is anything other than the deliberate ending of a human life is to ignore a biological reality.,1

"Man this place is getting more and more braindead (which is impressive) its like some of you Yank far right by even your country's standards and those are standards which make the Dem's look right wing to the civilised world never listen to any of the info about abortions and why people get them.\n\nAlso tend to be really wrong of when science considers them developed enough to fully count as human since just a heart beat isn't that high a bar to reach with a threshold of brain activity or viability being what actual experts tend to use as the cut off for legality outside the emergencies only morons don't support.",1
Yes I do want to kill babies,0
Just admit it you want to punish poor women for having sex.,0
"Life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nUnless you're a pregnant woman then your fetus takes priority.\n\nUntil it's born in which case fuck both of you.",0
Terminating a lifeless cluster of cells is not killing.,0
I like killing people the size of rice what you gonna do about it?,2
"tbh A fetus isn't a person you can tell me it is but it isn't",2
You are correct. And taking away abortion rights strip away liberty and pursuit of happiness from people.,0
None of those rights entitle you to another person’s body.\n\nI know that a lot of righties don’t consider women to be be people but they have *inalienable* rights too,0
"... unless you\'re a pregnant woman",0
I love killing babies. I kill thousands every time I jerk off.,0
"I'm pro life mate. I agree with you. This is not a left-right issue.",0
Seeing pro-choicers not just here by the way commonly refer to a fetus as a clump of cells is a major reason why I am starting to lean towards pro-life a little more than pro-choice. \n\nI’m all for women having the choice to do as they please but I don’t believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control. And don’t give me the whole arguments about rape incest and mothers health being at risk. The main reason for abortions are purely social reasons aka people don’t want to have the kids because they couldn’t be bothered to practice safer sex.,3
Just admit that you’re incapable of critical thought,0
Yeah get rekted little baby. Freedom for born people is more important,0
"This is an intractable disagreement because one side believes potential human life is always human life and is absolute on it and the other doesn't.\n\nThe truth is no one has any inherent or inalienable rights they don't fight for or gain through by petition to their fellows. The concept of rights are a liberalist pipedream.\n\nThat being said Some people choose to fight/petition for really r*tarded rights in the perspective of what is useful to society.",2
Not the checkmate you think it is who’s the “you” in this case?  The fetus that’s about as sentient as a jellyfish?  Or the Mother who some senators would prefer loses all three in favor of a life that hasn’t even begun yet,0

The fact that the L the G and the B still allow themselves to be forced into a group with the T and Q and whatever the alphabet soup is that comes after that still baffles me.,1
Stupid unsupportive parents neglecting their child with unsupportive food an unsupportive house unsupportive clothes and toys... What a kid really needs is some supportive oversexualization.,3
Ah yes we forget all the sex talk in school and kindergardens....that definetly doesnt install those ideas in kids or how children and tenagers want to be unigue and will make up sexualities to be one,3
ultra-conservatives saying \'stop showing porn to my child you are acting like a groomer\' is apparently taken very personally by the alphabet people. also very hilarious how you want to try to pretend this is about "politics" when you\'re acting surprised that very religious people don\'t like all "that gay stuff" lol I\'m sure this is straight fire in your teenage run subreddits but if you actually understood your oppositions belief system you would see this isn\'t some kind of an "own" it\'s a dumb meme showing you don\'t really understand something lol,1
The Christian way to do this would be to explain what the Bible says how homosexuality is a sin and having those feelings are the same as how some people are more inclined to lie and some people are more inclined to steal. If they continually reject that teaching you have to accept they\'re a reprobate and separate yourself from them. (Romans 1 lists a bunch of sins that when they become a lifestyle turn you into a reprobate. "Being full of murder" is one which we can all agree is different than manslaughter etc.)\n\nIf you don\'t believe in Christianity I don\'t expect you to believe this doctrine either. Many so-called Christians don\'t even understand the basic tenets taught in the Bible let alone a doctrine like this that allows for grace but is still just according to God.,1
Using gay as cover for the trans kids classic good one OP. There is nothing wrong with a parent not wanting their kids to transition until they are an adult to do. Calling this "abuse" is the dumbest argument I have seen so far. In before you say the meme is only about gay kids you could have put "gay kids" instead of lgbt.,1
The grooming I\'ve witnessed is coming from parents. 3-7 year olds who have "decided" they\'re non-binary or trans. No coincidence their parents are leftists.,1

Imagine thinking power inheritance is the same thing as basic rights to inherit your property from your people. This is why no one takes auth rights seriously.,0
Monarchs actually derived their right to rule from God. Equating feudal oppression to indigenous land title is typical of the based bullshit expected from authright though so you’re still good.,0

Dude. Why are you even on the right side of the spectrum if you support abortion. I can understand if you don’t want the government to ban it because of overreaches but from a personal stand point it makes no since why a rightist woudl support baby murder,1
"The government forcing people to have babies they don't want isn't very lib right to be fair more auth right.",1
Surely it should be the parents choice as to whether they wish to keep the baby regardless of the circumstance of its conception.,0
Baby has just as rights as you do asshole,3
Women who have abortions should be treated as murderers\n\nUnless the baby had a debilitating illness there is no not selfish reason to kill it therefore if you do you should be treated as a murderer,2
how is this a meme,0
"Honestly the pro-life stance on this issue makes 100% sense if you honestly believe that life begins at conception and that life is of equal value to that of a born baby. It's a silly belief IMO but the viewpoint that a rape victim should be forced to go through with the pregnancy doesn't come from apathy or immorality it comes from an honest belief (even if OP and I would agree that that belief is silly).",0
Based.,0
I didn’t read but fuck you too.,1
OP you’re based for standing on this hill in this particular subreddit.\n\nLot of people round here would revile the mother more than the rapist for aborting.,0
"Can't get much more REDACTED than this meme.",1
Who is “they?” \n\nJust because you’re raped that doesn’t give you a greenlight to achieve therapy by means of executing a baby. 2 wrongs don’t make a right.,2

Anyone care to show me ANY other situation where we base modern geopolitics based on what ethnic group lived where 2000 years ago?\n\nAnyone?\n\nAmerican Zionists sure love to think that a particular group is entitled to their “ancestral” homeland regardless of who might be living there now but do a complete 180 when it comes to native Americans.\n\nWhy the inconsistency?\n\nAnd mind you the Native American genocide and displacement is FARRRRR more recent than the ancient Israelite diaspora btw.,0

The electoral college system exists to make all states matter to some degree.

"Well since you bring these points let's review them 1 by one.\n\n1. John mccain has a photo taken during the maidan revolution standing right to a neonazi. \n\nThis doesn't prove anything there are photos of putin and every us president in the last years that does not prove they agree politically or are using one another. A photo of 2 people in one event only proves that they were in that event and (consequentially) support that event nothing more.\n\n2. Neocons play geopolitics in order to further the goals of their own countries. And as such US politicians seek to mantain US superpower monopoly\n\nOkay that has literally always been true. Literally every state tries to influence other states to their interest. That is what russia does when it supports certain parties or conflicts within countries or intervenes in others. I don't know what this brings to the table.\n\n3. Otan promised not to expand east yet did. \n\nVery overused and false argument.\nFirst it was a verbal promise not to move nato to east germany after reunification that was what was talked about since by then the USSR still existed and thus the only thing east of east germany was the USSR. \n\nSo it's ovbious they weren't asking for NATO not to include themselves in nato. \n\nSecond there is no document that states that NATO couldn't welcome new members after.\n\nThird after the colapse (1997 I think) of the USSR russia agreed with NATO that they couldn't veto each other meaning russia agreed that Nato could welcome new member states. \n\nSo this idea that nato is attacking russia is bulshit not only because of the previously stated but because NATO is a military alliance and has never gained new members by conquest only via diplomacy and its also a very sweet deal if you can join you get the greatest military force ever in history to protect you from any attack if you can join which country concerned with exterior threats wouldn't want that?? \n\n\nNow there are some points that I don't understand so I'll await your response. \n\n1. What are the political views of yuschenko (the candidate) that make him a neonazi? Because right now we only have smear by association via his wife. \n2. What work did the wife do for the Wh? Were they aware of their ideas? Even if they were it would not be the first time WH has supported an unethicsl party that better  suit their interests. That doesn't mean the support was illegitimate. \n\nAnd lastly why do you talk about the state of affairs previous to the euromaidan and not after that or the current situation?. That would seem more relevant into if ukraine has shitty nazi ideas today and thus if we should support them today that dubious association smears on previous politicians and cherrypicked and missrepresented agreements that were also already superceded by later agreements.\n\nI'll grant you some points evidently USA had an interest in mantaining it's superpower monopoly and thus it had an interest in trying to separate ukraine from russia that does not mean ukrainians didn't share this interest as well as most do today. It's also not the only state that does it heck russian interference in elections round the world makes the news every saturday.\n\nBut what you presented right here is Russian propaganda that much is clear. \n\nI do not know if you willingly constructed this argument yourself or just got convinced by the fallacies. Lastly I understand it's for the meme and tradition on this sub but try not to strawman your counterpart its inelegant.",1
I’m not sure what your point is,3
The USSR had nothing to say on nato expansion \nIt was an oral exchange nothing was settled down\nThe countries themselves asked to join NATO in fear of Russian expansion something completely justified seeing transnistria South Odessa and Lukachenko among others\nYour opinion is interesting and you make a lot of good points but it was important to me that I correct you on that point,1

Alright here I go again...\n\n1. The fact that John McCain took pictures himself with Oleh means nothing there are pictures of Trump and Kim Jong Un shaking hands.\n2. There is a pretty big jump from "McCain took pictures with Oleh" to "It was McCains job to push Yanukovych out of Ukraine" and when I say pretty big jump I mean it has zero evidence supporting it.\n3. "That woman" worked in the U.S. treasury and the fact that she previously worked in the white house doesn\'t mean that she was some sort of nazi plant. There is no evidence that she had any impact in how Ukraine was governed.\n4. Why does it matter what George Friedman says? He doesn\'t work in the U.S. government nor does he have any access to any information that would make this quote a smoking gun.\n5. I want to make this very clear NATO NEVER promised not to expand east it did not happen that is a myth. The myth that NATO promised not to expand east comes from a verbal agreement with no evidence that these verbal promises actually occurred and HARD evidence that this "agreement" had no legal precedent.\n6. The fact that russia is invading Ukraine so they don\'t join NATO isn\'t some kind of conspiracy. It is most certainly what is happening they did the same thing to Georgia and it\'s why they\'ve been backing the separatists in Ukraine this whole time. This of course has nothing to do with nazi\'s so I\'m not sure why you\'ve brought it up.\n7. In war there are rarely good sides this is one of those cases. Ukraine did NOTHING to warrant this the people of Ukraine did nothing to deserve this suffering on one side you have an imperialist war machine attempting to forcefully exert its power over a smaller country and on the other you have a people doing everything they can to defend their home and family. Russia has no reason to be doing this you cannot strike someone for no reason and then hide behind the "there are no good sides in war" card Ukraine did nothing to provoke this. This is an act of unchecked aggression and Ukraine is 100% the good guy in this situation.\n\nAlso Ukraine has a Jewish president and russia bombed a holocaust memorial lmao,1
The first comment by the centrist Wojak is still true(?). So were is the point?,1

God loves you unconditionally. No matter your wrongdoings. He sees my wrongdoings no less than any non-believer. I will do wrong. Many Christians do/have not live what that preaches. That is not the voice of Christ but the voice of sinful beings. I’m no better than you they are no better than you.\n\n***For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.***\n\nYou make that choice to follow him and accept salvation. You choose against that? Despite his unending desire to spend eternity with us he loves you enough to respect that decision. He tells you where that decision leads and leaves you be as you wish.\n\nWhere is the wrong in that I wonder?,1

dear PCM you are now no different from the rest of political subreddits it was fun while it lasted,1

Funny how commenting a truth is now becoming a banable offense. Like there is a whole huge group that considers being transgender a type of mental illness and transition as a mean of treatment for those people and not just being observer but themselves consider it as such and this claim is backed by psychological research on this topic as well.

That's certainly not an irrelevant amount but considering that if you're really broke the lunches are free and that it goes towards keeping your kid fed that isn't unreasonable. It would be hard to make a meal cheaper and you can always make a kids lunch if you can.\n\nIf as a parent making above the threshold to qualify for government assistance you're not paying for your child to eat if only in the small window of the day needed to keep up public appearances why would that not be taken as a potential symptom of neglect or incompetence?\n\nI'm not even saying that the child needs to be taken away middle class folks can have money problems too especially these days but some parents also just don't give a shit about their kids.

The conversation was about BIDEN clearly. He didn’t even bring up the 12 year old thing.

Yea and you probably shouldn’t make a “satirical” video about “we’re coming for your kids” when a number of the participants are sex offenders… or regardless of said participants’ sex offender status tbh. \n\nLike 10 years ago they claimed the only “gay agenda” was just wanting to be left alone and I still think that’s what most people want but idk man are you rational gays out there at least trying to talk sense into these people?

We are a constitutional republic. Do we democratically elect the president? No. Do we vote for laws? No. We elect REPRESENTATIVES who vote for laws and create legislation on our behalf (the textbook definition of a republic).,1
"The US is a banana Republic controlled by lobby groups and you can't change my mind.",0
To be fair the founding fathers tended to think of democracy as "that thing that leads to mob rule" because they talk about "pure democracy" by which they mean what we now call direct democracy. Representative democracy on the other hand is when you elect your leaders which overlaps with republics but isn\'t the same thing. A republic means an elected head of state. So for example the UK is not a republic but is a representative democracy because the queen is not elected but parliament is while the US is both a republic and a representative democracy because both the president and congress are elected.,0
The founding fathers were the lost fathers until they found themselves,0
Well a lot of people are catching the stupid (lib leftism) and can’t be allowed to have a say in things that actually matter,1
Its not a democracy in the first place\n\n1. Only the rich can become political leaders because u gotta finance your campaign yourself (or need someone to support u which makes u vulnerable)\n \n2. Who the fuck created your voting system? People can have less than their competitor in overall votes and win ?\n\n3.

I’m a straight male and I don’t think either are acceptable,3
Where would a child see the bottom one? Definitely not by the sea nor the swimming pool.,3
OP’s bio and post history suggest he is mentally unstable. I don’t see why everyone is so surprised that this meme is stupid as hell.,1
"Difference is that one isn't paraded shoved down your throat in public. Women wear bathing suites to the beach. Men parade themselves in public in assless chaps making everyone else a part of their fetish.",3
Both of these are absolute degenracy and extremely haram.,3
Demonstration of how it is about intend and not about outcome.,1
Very much depends on the context and where and when the items of clothing are being worn. The top image is acceptable because it is swimwear and only socially acceptable in the setting of a beach or a swimming pool and several other specific locations. Assess chaps are acceptable in certain social settings. In a party with friends and other specific locations with areas that the population entering can be controlled as the clothing is considered to be sexually explicit. But if you wear either in a social situation where they are not considered acceptable such as going to work walking about in a shopping market generally walking around town. You will get the same shocked reaction to both. Furthermore you could put a woman in assless chaps and you’d get the exact same response.,1
"I think it's mostly the cocks people have issues with",1

For fuck\'s sake dude the only thing birth control does is makes you more reliant on your pull out game and makes that less reliable.\n\nAccidental children are NOT going to be treated the same as purposeful children and you damn well know that.\n\nAnd before you say "but birth control is going to be banned so they\'ll have more responsible!!!" No. They\'re not going to be more responsible. They\'re just going to have oral sex instead get condoms or pills from the black market or just fucking throw their babies away before they stop having sex with random people,1

I really doubt banning birth control will reduce sexual immorality before marriage in society,0
So you want more bastard children in society? Because this is how get more bastard children. The reality is banning birth control or abortion is too far down from the problem. The only way to actually decrease abortion would be to have some type of cultural/religious Revolution or something that causes the society at large to shift their change on abortion so that peoples base values will tell them to wait till marriage be more responsible with their birth control or at least encourage them to get married and stay together if they create a kid together. And also a society that rewards child rearing (tax credits etc) and places value on such things. Doing a ban downstream is just going to make the people have casual sex get pregnant and raise kids with single parents. That being said I have absolutely no idea how to have a revolution like that other than some massive catastrophe or war against an obviously evil figure (like Hitler for example) to unite the people and force people to take on more responsibility. The pandemic didn’t work because it didn’t make people take responsibility working from home not going to the gym and staying indoors is decreasing responsibility not increasing,1

Too religious and nationalistic unlike the Muslim refugees?

I think alignment is independent of your political compass.,1

Considering the way my DM uses alignment this could work. He puts “good” as acting for the good of others and “evil” as acting for the self. It doesn’t actually determine moral goodness,1
Go back to r/politicalhumor,3
"Here would be my version:\n\n**Lawful Good:** Centrists. By far the most diplomatic; commonly referred to as a grill zone. Actually enjoyable to be with and by many means I agree with. Probably gets into fights the least.\n\n**Neutral Good \\[home quadrant\\]:** LibLeft. My home quadrant. Social justice warriors are commonly placed here but from what I've seen these are predominantly kind-hearted and just want to have some peace amid total chaos which I'll refer to later.\n\n**Chaotic Good:** LibCentre. Probably the most anarchic (not libleft). Anarchy is not a very ideal society to live in but we share a top moral; freedom which I am also open to discuss.\n\n**Lawful Neutral:** Right. Along with AuthRight they most fit the state of present-day America even have their respect for Joe Biden who I was rooting for after Bernie Sanders withdrew.\n\n**True Neutral:** LibRight. Not a **single** paedophile have I met here but yes this quadrant is full of diverse personalities particularly embedded in capitalism and libertarianism.\n\n**Chaotic Neutral:** Left. A very contested flair; containing cheerful egalitarians wise long-term environmentalists and just plain alt-left bigots alike.\n\n**Lawful Evil:** AuthLeft. Communism is quite infamous for some straight-up cruel actions now extending to racism. Great concept but often **abysmal** implementation. I do inherit some morale from here though.\n\n**Neutral Evil \\[impostor zone\\]:** AuthRight. By far the most complicated most embedded in history... There are many people with this flair along these lines taking offensive approaches and therefore I strongly disagree with.\n\n**Chaotic Evil \\[impostor zone\\]:** AuthCentre. Contains probably the most extremists even if there are not as many people with the flair as there are with authright.

Five years is generous af anyway usually rapists aren’t even convicted because of a lack of evidence in a shit ton of cases. Not that I agree with your argument.,0
Good point. However I think sometimes society has to kill people. Pro death penalty. Pro abortion.,0
I understand but disagree,0
Wtf is this?,0
Always consider the consequences of all your actions... especially getting a piece of ass.,1
"I'm... damn I never thought I'd say this but I'm with Orange on this one.",1
Id say that rape is a worse crime either way it’s time to ride the lightning,3
"If pro lifers care that much about the baby of a rape victim instead of jail time there should be a second option to force them to pay a huge amount of child care. #1 cited reason for an abortion is financial instability and spending taxpayer's money for a jail sentence and Planned Parenthood is so dumb compared to just having the rapist have to pay child support + reparations for the crime",1
this is literally the worst take i have ever seen,2
This argument is terrible but I understand pro-lifers especially because I was before.,1
I maintain that most of these are from states that have had heavy California migration and are passing laws Californians view as the worst thing possible to try and get them to move back.,1
"Lol I get the argument I just think you're a piece of shit.",0
Glad I got my fix of retarded takes on PCM for today all from this post.,2
Even if you ban it people will find ways to do it they can easily go to other countries to do it or even other states,0
There are people who will swear up and down that the entire pro-life movement is just a front and that the real goal is just to punish women for sleeping around.,3
"What If I don't really give a fuck what you believe? Whether or not a Fetus should be considered equal to a born human is entirely philosophical and entirely a matter of opinion. For as long as that is the case there should be no law compelling anyone to abide by arbitrary principles based on YOUR beliefs.\n\nYou see this every time there is a debate about abortion. One side thinks an embryo/fetus is a equal to a born human life and the other simply does not. There is nothing at all tangible to confirm which is right so why in the world should it be implemented into law?",1
Murder should be treated similarly to rape in terms of consequences,1
I mean I know I am Auth-right but I kinda agree with orange on this one...,3
The pro life argument is garbage and I refuse to respect it,1
Rape is worse than murder especially ones that lead to pregnancy\n\nMurder Im gone\n\nRape and baby Im spending the rest of my life basically to raise this kid that I did not expect as well as the hardships I’ll have to go through while the rapist just spends a few years in prison and can just leave a do it again\n\nBlue is cringe apathetic soyjack not even close to chad,1
"While I fully support women's right to kill their baby it really blows my mind how much they twist the other argument",0
"It's a pretty fucking stupid argument though.",0
I think maybe people should keep their opinions to themselves if they haven’t experienced rape. \nConservatives really be out here reminding everyone that women are the weaker sex and acknowledging biology and then also spewing their  opinions on rape in such a retarded manner. What exactly do you all believe. If women are the inherently weaker sex why are we then choosing to punish women that have experienced violence at the hands of the dominant sex and implying that rape isn’t that bad. What happened to the strong good natured Christian men that protect vulnerable weaker women?,0
This is such a funny political compass meme,0
This has got to be the shittiest take I’ve ever seen from this sub and I am a Roman Catholic.,2

"Hot take: I believe rape is worse than murder. At least you don't feel the pain from being murdered rape trauma as with all trauma will always be with you causing some degree of mental distress.",0
Bruh.   Ok that’s fine and I respect your opinion. However for those of us who know that until later in development that a fetus is basically just a bunch of cells.  Not to mention you shouldn’t force your views on another person.  This law is b.s because it is mixing religion and politics.  There’s no place in government for religion.  Separation of church and state.,0
5 years is way too fucking low,1
Regardless what you believe it’s been proven it’s not murder I can post many studies if anyone wants a gander.,0

When one side is against proper sexual education and easy access to contraceptives two things that would MASSIVELY reduce abortion numbers you can be sure this was about controlling women the whole time.,0

Reddit does not hold all users accountable equally. I have directly reported calls to violence against SCOTUS justices to the admins and gotten responses back that “the comment does not violate our TOS”.\n\nBest part is I’ve seen entire subreddits banned for alleged content they never supported (TD banned for calling to arms against cops despite Back the Blue being one of their rally cries),3
"I use reddit to avoid bubbles I have them on twitter and 4chan already. Banning huge and old subs because the users don't think you can change your gender is imposing more then just arbitrary rules",1
"They've changed the rules between the creation date of many accounts and present day. Additionally the TOS purposely uses vague language to shift banworthy content to mean whatever the admins don't agree with.",1
The rules have always been the same? I’ve been on this site 9 years and this place has changed dramatically in that time,0
We are complaining about the rules themselves tho dumbass. You can like Reddit as a platform but want them to have different rules.,1
\\[removed\\],1
"1 ) the rules always changes without users consent. \n\n2 ) moderators don't follow their own rules and abuse their powers to comply with their ideology",3
The new rules that have been placed on the subreddit are Reddits rules that they want to enforce. It maybe censorship in your mind depending on your opinion but Reddit is a company. They can enforce whatever rules they want on the use of their platform. Censorship is when the government limits your speech. A company can do whatever they want. \n\nIt’s the same as if we were at work and started swearing at other workers calling other employees names etc. we would get fired. We have free speech but not freedom from the consequences of that speech. \n\nI disagree with the new rules in theory but Reddit can enforce whatever they want. Don’t like the rules leave the Reddit. Go use truth social or some shit other instead.,0
I think everyone should just leave reddit,0

I believe people should not have an advantage or disadvantage in college admissions because of race. That Latinos or Asians should not have to vote Democratic or Republican but whatever party **they** want to. Ideology should be separated from race. And that people of all races can be racist hateful but also kind. Race political ideology religion whatever: MLK said people should be judged not for race but for character. So to recap I am obsessed with idpol: obsessed with ending it and making it a thing of the past.,1

Biden: *WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE I AM*,3
I don\'t understand how it\'s possible for people to legitimately be freaking out this much about it. Bernie lost weeks ago. Dropping out was a formality.\n\nLook I love the guy and I absolutely think he would have been a better president than either Trump or Biden but after Super Tuesday I knew his chances were slim-to-none and they only got worse. I had friends still posting campaign stuff saying "We\'re not done yet! The race isn\'t even halfway over!" and I kept trying to explain to them that election math doesn\'t work like that. Bernie didn\'t need to win by a little he needed to win by a *lot.* Huge double digit margins week after week state after state all over the country if he wanted to actually catch up to Biden.\n\nTurns out that radically improbable things don\'t happen very often. I\'m sorry. It sucks. That\'s life.,0
Now that he has the nomination he’s going to stop shaking hands and switch to just groping everyone’s genitals in greeting,0
"Honestly like fair enough the establishment pulled together and made it so we couldn't recover from super Tuesday. Like it's a dick move but you do what you can.\n\nMy issue is of all the candidates in stage they picked biden the only one worse was Bloomberg.",0

Centrist dems on reddit are now acting like that kid who on christmas got a shitty toy and is now mad that nobody wants to play with their toy.\n\nHey assholes Biden was the least popular among young people not just compared to sanders but almost all other candidates since january.

Small but effective at stopping degeneracy,3
I’m a republican and I think that gay marriage and weed should be legal. I could care less for who marries who and who wants to accelerate their death but the government has no right to regulate it that’s unconstitutional. Also the govt. could make so much money off of taxing weed. And it would allow for so many knew jobs and investments as well as less people in prison. I’m straight and don’t smoke weed myself but from an economic standpoint it would be stupid to not have these things be legal.,1

"To be honest he kinda has a point. I hate that I have to agree with him but class divided have become increasingly large and are becoming a stronger divide than any racial lines we try to draw. That said Tucker is failing to acknowledge that class lines and racial lines are strongly correlated for to many racist policies put in place by the government and corporations. These policies which are at the root of this problem are the same ones the Trump administration supports.\n\nAlso with all his talk of rich elites in the media brainwashing people it's a little ironic given the fact he inherited millions from his step-mom's TV dinner business and he is himself an elitist doing the bidding of his even richer bosses at Fox News.",0

"Carlson is a nationalist first traditionalist second social conservative third and populist last. He was once partially libertarian but has since changed his populist stance into also economic populism.\n\nThis seems to have developed not long after Trump became President and it is hard to know if he just sucked Trump's dick so hard that he absorbed Trump's neo-liberal (or fascist?) economic policies combined with his love of flexing over the markets or if he was in hiding all this time and trying to lay low because he thought the Tea Party pseudo-libertarianism was going places.\n\nIf we went full fascist tomorrow this fucker is in. Also if we went full Stalin-style tankie communist tomorrow he may put up some fight at first but by week 4 this fucker will also be in.

Jokes on you I use sapply.,2
"It's that old?!",3
look where are we now,1
"I don't give a shit about politics. Economics however that's an actual thing I care about.",1
"'scuze me? i am an expert i have watched hours of yt",1
Hey at least we are nice retards. We could be the psycho retards in every other political subreddit,1
We aren’t experts on politics we’re experts on political retards.,1
"The test is as old as most of the users on here though I'm one to talk",1
"Hah yeah AHS are stupid! That's who we're talking about right? Guys? Fellow political exper... Oh",2
Idk. Every time I come to this subreddit i just see some right winger spewing racist and bigoted bullshit "as a meme",0
This test is as old as me holy shit,1
On no other subreddit would you see a Nazi and a communist having a productive well normal conversation we’ve shown that even by expressing our political beliefs we can still get along our ‘enemies’ are simply people we disagree with deep down we breath the same air and the same planet thank you guys for everything.,2
Holy crap the awards. Not based.,3
I think floating up is a form of evolution. Suck it darwin,3
Hey speak for yourself. My ideology is right.,2
Has COVID made anyone else so dreadfully bored that they’ve considered cancelling themselves just to feel some excitement?,1
I never even took the test,3

I like Ireland and am proud of my heritage of fucking with the British,2
"I've been banned from half of the major subreddits for racism sexism transphobia and islamophobia. \n\nPolitical compass: LibLeft",0
Honestly if you’re proud of your country then it shows your happy with the status quo more than anything. So unless you live in Nazi Germany (always a possibility) then...,2
"Am I proud of my country not really I am proud of United States people and I would never hate the people but when I hear country I think government fuck that shit rn I see a million things that could be fixed everyday and I ain't gonna quit till we've reached the perfect society full unabridged libertarianism",1
I would Press Hard no. Im proud of no one not even myself .,1
"Not gonna lie but if you ain't patriotic get out of my country",3
"It is because I'm proud of my country that I'm willing to point out it's flaws and advocate for change.",0

"Why should we recognize different nations If we can all be one under a Worker's Paradise? Nationalism is imperialism and must be exterminated. There should be no Super-Powers. Only communes. Just communes...",2
Nooo lib left! U R being groomed by auth right!! Cant you see that he is wearing the mask??!,1
Is the American left going to dabble in a little bit of accelerationism this time round too? \n\nWould give Zizek something to do.,2
You really need more than two parties to vote from ffs,0

The hardest part of this election is I cant decide if I want to see liberals melt down or if I want to see dementia man try to run a country.,2

"It's starting again in a few weeks saying anything bad about ~~Hillary~~ Biden will cause the reddit downvote crusade. \n\n2016 2.0 is in full effect.",0
"From what I've gathered Biden isn't actually senile but rather a weird fucking fella and has been this way for decades. I've got a question from an outside the USA perspective - seeing as Biden was Obama's VP wouldn't Biden be good since he probably has similar views which makes him as unlikely to cause the end of the world as Obama was?\n\nI'm asking mostly because that's how we rate american presidents over here. Trump is a big no-no because we've been re-prepping the bunkers every other day since he was elected.",3

"Whoa whoa whoa you didn\'t tell me *I* was getting the money!",0
People losing their jobs tend to move left regardless of stimulus as cute as the idea is.,3
"Until you realise that the money you get pales in comparison to the money that the corporations get. Considering most of these corporations do their best to avoid paying tax I don't think it is quite fair.",0
"Thanks for returning my money gubberment I'm buying a gun with it.",3
Imagine thinking Keynesian economics is communism,1
"AuthLeft: Here's some money now admit that socialism is the best thing ever. \n\nAuthright: Here's some money now admit that Trump is the best president ever. \n\nLibRight: Give me back the *rest* of my money you fucking thieves.",1
If you find people who are authright that swap like little bitches then they were never auth right,3
How do you turn a Republican into a socialist? $1200 apparently.,2
>authright\n\n>Unemployed\n\nNice try wagies,3
An authright framework has much leeway in terms of what is good for the economy and the state. The difference is that an authright framework believes that morality and economics should come out of what is good for the state rather than what is good for the people. \n\nIn this case what is good for the people goes hand in hand with what is good for the state.,3
"Gov't doesn't have money. They're giving you back some of the money they stole. It's a power lib right move in disguise.",1
"stimulus checks aren't communism it's the government giving back the money it already stole from you.",1
You do realize that the government is just giving back what they took from you to begin with?,1
"The kissing is unrealistic because that's not proper social distance.",0
I’d rather starve than get a stimulus check. I won’t affiliate with the people fucking their cousins to have child benefits for the rest of their lives.,1
A legitimately funny post on this sub? It is truly a time of great social upheaval.,0
I would probably turn nazbol ngl,1
Giving people free money is still cringe,3
No they take the check to repay themselves a little bit for all of their taxes that were stolen from them. Now I have an excuse to take the check with out it being socialism.,1
no you see I look at it as a tax return,1
"Nope. That's tiger money right there though.",3
No. I refuse,2
sometimes this website is alright. \n\nthanks OP,0
It goes both ways though. A lot of [leftists](https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/1250297852481294339?fbclid=IwAR3FgCEPm6gDdy-23HBEI8hz_d-UmyDt5nDmWjKmbjdeHgN5LbG0ogyFqec) are getting their checks with Trumps name on it and are realizing for the first time that taxation is theft.,3

Poor Libleft. How will they change the definition of protests and riots so the stuff they did over the summer sounds heroic while making Authright's actions sound bad?",1
This is my final push from right to lib right. Fuck the government,1
Did they destroy small bussinesses? Cause i think there would be even more of an uproar about it if they did indeed do that all i\'ve heard and seen is they protesting to the goverment and congress which is what the other morons should\'ve donde aswell instead of burning down livelihoods. Now if these people did indeed do similar shit like those antifa nutjobs then im open to change my mind on this topic so far i don\'t see a reason to get crazy about this other than the orange liblefts saying shit like "those pigs on the right were whining about out protest and look at them now smh hypocrits" but it\'s not the same afaik lol,1

Look you can have an SJW superhero. Arguably that\'s what a lot of superheroes were. But you can\'t just base their entire power and character on current trends. \n\nBatman isnt limited to one time period. He\'s a Zorro-esque vigilante whose parents were killed. You can INCORPORATE modern politics and cultural fads into new Batman comics but at his core he\'s not going to go obsolete. \n\nEven X-Men which DID pull a lot from politics of its time kept their heroes\' powers costumes and personalities timeless. \n\nMaybe they\'ll prove us wrong but these guys seem entirely based on "hmm what are the kids into these days?" They\'ll go stale in a few months if that.,0

I think you’re confusing r/libertarian with r/Anarcho_Capitalism,1
WOW against hate subreddit was right. Look at how evil and hateful this post is!,0
I mean. Libleft could be liberty equality order. the goal is that we all enjoy liberty equaly in an order without vertical hierarchy. Also it seems like I just began to write a wall of text to explain the libleft position on those 3 words so I guess the meme was accurate with all its imperfection because the meme ask a definition of the political value with only one  word that could mean basicaly anything depending of the interpretation we make. The fact is that the libleft inpretation of those words is more true and more useful that the one each other quadrant use. the concept of liberty for exemple in the libright interpretation would be more accurately described as the dictatorship of the capital because the liberty they defend is based on the value of the property each person possesses as such the interest of those who own nothing would not be respected and only those who can use their capital will rightfully influence the way society work in this paradigm thus the level of liberty each person enjoy would vary according to their relative wealth so tbe less wealthy would not have the same liberty that the rich would enjoy. liberty without equality is the tyrany of the powerful. Secondly the order autright defend is in fact chaos. The autright claim that their subjective perspective of what normality should be the eternal order and they never acknoledge that their idea doesnt correspond to reality and thus the "order" they create always have to fight against the reality that the world doesnt comply with the delusion they live in because of the idea that they protect   their order against the true order in which every progressive movement strive toward they create and entertain the dialectical struggle between reality and the illusion of a pure tradition creating chaos a struggle between the old and the new and a war between reality and the narative that keep them in power. A true order would be to accept and evolve with the world and its diversity rather than to fight for the violent dominion of one\'s subjective archetype over the other. In fact Anarchy is order! damn I\'m tired please for the rest imagined that I continue my rant by explaining how equality need freedom to be useful and that equality alone without taking needs into account contradictory and that only free and equal access to the means and the fruits of production is can bring a more healthy type of equality. to conclude not only is liberty order and equality not contradictory they have to evolve in unity with one another to realy bring the best of each concept and the libleft position is the only that acknowledge and impleament them as such. The Autright oppose Progress with Order and only create Chaos. The Libright oppose Equality with Liberty and Autleft oppose Liberty with Equality and both can only create Tyrany. Only with libleft   can Liberty and Equality Anarchy and communism colaborate and thrive and bring true Order by evolving with the world instead of opposing it.,0

Human rights are arbitrary nonsense used to justify big government which does nothing but violate rights.,1

But on the lib-auth scale while PolComp usually gives me around -8 supply gave me like -4.5 (or I guess 4.5 since I think Sapply uses negative signs for auth scores). Sapply made more sense to me since while I'm usually pretty libertarian on lib-auth issues (post-9/11 abuses of power and incidents like Snowden and Wikileaks are a big part of what formed my worldview) I'm not an anarchist by any means.",0

Thank you,0
Recommending masks is fine. Shutting down the economy and locking the country up like cattle is not.,1
Keep your social contracts out of my quadrant you grilling statist fuck,1
"Wouldn't allowing everyone to get infected mean we gain herd immunity faster and thus avoiding second/third/fourth waves? Meaning we can get the economy back on track even faster? Which is better for more people in the long run. \n\n\nThe tyranny of the minority ruins so many things.",1
tl;dr,3
BUT I NEED A HAIRCUT,2
Lib right on lib right memes! Oh god the balance of power is tilting on this sub. Tankies quick say something cringy!,1
I love these wholesome fucking memes,1
The social contract within the constitution isn’t inherently Rousseauian in nature. It would be a lot more tyrannical if it was. It strikes me more as Lockeian. Still a good argument though.,1
"I can't wait for the libleft one but also I don't think I can scroll for that long",0
"ITT: Librights who don't understand basic political philosophy and that the NAP is a form of social contract.",0
Based and correct. Just because you have the freedom to be a dipshit doesn’t mean you *should*.,1
Lib right is making us proud,3
Also not trying to violate the NAP,1
>Rousseau  \n\nNope fuck off and take your statist dew rag with you phony.,1
Its not suggested in europe in italy they can arrest you if youre not wearing a mask. Fuck off with this bootlicking shit,1
Is there a name for this meme? It’s like consistently been fighting your majority of your group.,1
Chad v dimwit,1
Not wearing a mask breaks the NAP,0
LETS BUY SOME MASKS,0
This is honestly my biggest complaint within my quadrant. It seems like there is always this knee jerk reaction to hate everything the government or government employees too even if it makes sense or is more or less harmless. People let ideology get in the way of practicality.,1
OP kneel.  By the rite of the Founding Fathers by the Will of the People I bestow up thee the title of True American. You may rise.,0
Back in the old days people were so racist they didn’t let white people pick cotton. Never again,3
No libright believes in the social contract.,1
"Social... Contract? I don't remember signing shit",1
Yeah the amount of anti-science coming from lib right has made me leave several of my favorite subreddits. I actually saw a dude say “yeah my uncle died of coronavirus in nyc but I still think it’s not a big deal. I live in Ohio btw.”,1
"These are the people I'd want liberal unity with",0
B A S E D,1
Nice,1
Glad to see I’m not the only one who sees spreading a pandemic as a violation of the NAP,1
My dad is pretty adamant about not wearing a mask he uses the justification of Asthma but only partially the biggest reason is because he hates the government so much for "allowing the Jews to run amok" and "letting the Chinese get away with this"\n\nThen he turns around with the same anti-vac views he\'s held since before I was born and says that the vaccine is another ploy to depopulate the human race.\n\nI really can\'t wait to move the fuck out with my brother.,0
But bleach go brrr..,0
While I object to the "social contract" aspect of this argument the rest of it is quite sound.,1
LOL social contract; you had me in the the first half not gonna lie.,1
I was with the guy on the right until he quoted Rousseau. Fuck that proto-socialist statist.,1
BTW did you know that if you have a mask and not the COVID and someone with COVID coughs on you you have a 75% chance of getting it?\n\nBut if you HAVE the COVID and wear a mask you have a 3% chance of spreading it?\n\nALSO there are people that have the COVID but no symptoms?\n\nIt could anyone of us it could be you it could be ME it could even be...,0
While I do wear a mask when I go out the idea that not doing so will make this last longer is just patently false. The goal with social distancing and the like was to flatten the curve. Effectively to make things last *longer* to prevent hospitals from getting overwhelmed due to everyone getting sick at once.,1
Why the hell is LibLeft part of the police,0
Should I watch SpongeBob?\n\nI know that Russian Army considers it worthwhile enough to include the theme in their marching songs but should I?,2
This sub is like an auth-right family reunion. Everyone’s retarded and trying to fuck each other.,3
A small price to pay,3
The blue team is immune to being made fun of. What are you gonna do? Call them a cracker? Remind them when they use to own people?,0
Bruh commies are retardet,3
QUICK! Someone hand me my pacifier!,1
"Isn't that the entire point of this sub?",3
Oh no... im shaking in my boots.,3
rightists: "Ha liberal snowflakes are so fragile they can\'t handle someone mocking their ideology! Pathetic!"\n\nalso rightists: "Stop circlejerking anti-trump jokes! Why is every subreddit against my opinions and why do they all make fun of me! It\'s not fair!",1
Ok commie,3

HAHAHAAHAHA LIBRIGHT SELLING THINGS? XDDDDDD SO FUNNNYYTYTTRYYYYU FUNNY FUNYY LOL PICKLE RICKKLK,2

I can always count on this sub for a chuckle.,2

Are rage comics coming back? Have memes come full circle?,0
"A good opportunity for libleft and centerleft to appreciate the expected outcome of giving the government too much power even if one thinks the situation calls for it: Trampled citizen's rights and no solution in sight for the original problem.",3
hahaha implying the government can tell me who i am hahaha,0
I wonder whats gonna be the new boogyman they can dangle in front of the populace,0
Got rid of non-essential services including non-essential genders.\n\n#BASED.,3
"America: Hey bro let's cancel abortion rights in the corona bill and when the libcucks complain let's blame them for delaying aid",0
based,1
More like they used the chaos as an opportunity to pass a hateful law without people noticing. They didn’t use any new powers let alone powers given by them by experts telling people to stay at home lol,0
smh i thought conservatives were against cancel culture so much for the tolerant right >:(,0
"This isn't ending trans rights. They just don't legally recognise them lmao world literally ending",0
this comment section finally convinced me to leave the sub,0
How the fuck do the two correlate ??,2
God bless Hungary,3
Based orban,3
The prequels were a lot different than I remember!,0
Lmao,1
Hungary is very based NGL,3
Ok this is actually fucked though.,0
Honestly I mainly just don\'t understand the thought process on this kind of thing.\n\n"Ah yes a horrible pandemic and I have unlimited power? Let\'s actively suppress a group of people. Huh? What for? .............Let\'s do it!"\n\nJust... why is that the go to? What purpose does it possibly serve?,0
righty and centrist subhumans really tryin hard to get this sub boomed with this comment section,2
Knew that I would see transphobia in the comments and I have not been disappointed,0
"Broke: I dont support trans rights\n\nWoke: trans rights are human rights\n\nBespoke: I dont support trans rights because they're human rights",0
The whole compass: Yes.,1

I don’t like Mao. He kinda caused a huge famine because he hated sparrows.,2
"I'm vegetarian but would eat the rich any damn day.",0
"Who DOESN'T believe taxation is theft?\n\n\n\nAll your replies are incredibly amusing. I'm glad I didn't /s the comment.",1
Yes I hate taxation and am a furry. We exist.,0
Taxation is indeed theft. thus tax fraud is a form of self defense.,1
"wait you guys **don't** actually want to kill everyone that tresspasses on your property? I thought it was a joke.",1
I surprisingly find the LibRight one to make the most sense in here,0
"Wait you guys AREN'T actually ephebophiles?",1
I always thought I was Rightunity but libright is the only one I’d fight a war for.\n\n(Sorry Authright),1
"I would never eat a grown human they're disgusting and essentially poisonous.\n\n... now rich BABIES that's the stuff.",0
Oh wow the opinion of a centrist a slightly better unflaired.,3
Rich people can afford to be delicious,0
"You'd better hurry up libleft.\n\nOnce automation and AI start to fully mature as alternate labor sources and combat units the rich will not need the plebs anymore. Things like UBI will be used to keep the masses placated until the point where they are truly expendable. \n\nAt that point its radical depopulation time maybe with an engineered virus or something...\n\nThe elite are on the cusp of a technological endgame. At that point the dinner bell will toll; it will toll for thee!\n\n...and that's a good thing. With a population of ~500M the Earth will be returned almost entirely to nature and resource usage carbon output and pollution will plummet because a) less people b) less logistics to serve one of a few centralised human zones c) greater efficiency due to fully intelligent automation. \n\nHell a collectivist economic model would be not only possible but likely under such conditions; post scarcity communism could be realistically attainable. \n\nTake the depopulation pill.",3
Tbf any negative remark / “hate fact” about any non White group is perceived by 9/10 as pure hate and racism and they’ve never been more certain.,3
fuck mao,2

I subbed recently here and holy shit amazing post,1

Now this is a political compass meme I can get behind,0
Panzer of the Lake is a superior template to this,3
"What's this anime?",3
"Nah all the fat dudes in their mother's basement are Simps in my quadrant",0
But some quadrants have more weebs than others.\n\n*glances at libunity*,1
"I enjoy some JoJos Bizzare adventure but I don't realy follow anime that much beyond that.",1
Disgusting weebs make me feel authright. We must purge society of this degeneracy,1

Well I am autistic so this becomes slightly awkward.,2
Please don’t insult autistic people,0
Notice that yellow is the color that didn’t move indicating that we librights are the maximum autists.,1
Based and vaccinated,1
I actually learned for the first time ever a few days ago there are people who believe autism doesn’t exist,0
Have we really sunk down to the level of stealing memes from r/wallstreetbets ?,1

Appropriating a post from r/WSB and reaping huge profits... yup definitely LibRight,2

Lehman Brothers -> r/wallstreetbets,1
my fav sub is the sub who laughs " haha we\'re autistic!!!",1
Lmao I didn’t even realize this post was on this sub. I was looking at them carefully till the end,0
I cannot believe that it has all the funny colors but not in the correct funny color order,1

I feel attacked.,1
#WEAPONIZED AUTISM REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,0
As an actual autistic person I couldn’t be prouder.,0
dont mind me scrolling down for libleft,0
Hey don’t insult the autistic like that!,1
the lego logo was so cute though,1
Top unity (authright x libleft),0
i give this meme the nword pass of using autism,0
"can confirm as an actual autistic person we're all dumb",0
We may think that we are so different and take those quadrants as a personality trait but everyone is actually sitting in a very small quadrant right now losing their lives watching retarded memes. We are all from the same quadrant. A small one.,0
"That's r/politics",3
AuthRight on Day 1 of Biden Administration: “We are officially New Venezuela.”,0
Yo has anyone checked on auth right?,1
The best part is libleft acting like Randy Marsh when Obama was elected "CHANGE!!!! IT\'S...IT\'S....CHANGE!!!" then it will soon be "He said things were going to be different! That son of a bitch lied to us!! I knew I should\'ve voted for McCain!!",1
"Socialism is when the government does stuff. And the more stuff it does the more socialist-er it is. And if it does a real lot of stuff it's communism!",0
"Trump wasn't particularly economically right wing he just wanted low taxes and little regulation on his own companies\n\nPurely selfish reasons",0
Honestly the Republicans should be happy. As long as they win the runoffs in Georgia they still control the senate and have gained ground in the house. This combines with the fact that they gained two state legislative chambers and one governor. As long as they win the senate 2022 is already a wash for the dems and as long as they choose another populist who is not a blowhard they have a chance of winning in 2024.,1
"Nah libright isn't happy about Biden. We're never happy but Biden-Harris is a very authcenter ticket. Further auth than Trump (pro-war mask mandates gun control Kamala is a cop etc) and less economically right than Trump (tax hikes environmentalism etc).\n\nI didn't vote for either party but I'm hardly smiling under my mask. Better authright than authcenterright from a libright POV. Pretty sure Kamala is just authcenter.",1
Yeah cause abortion gay marriage LGBT rights a flood of immigration legilasation of more drugs harsher firearm restrictions are totally auth right.,3
Libleft being depicted as accurate as always,3
Lol if you think Biden is in power you are wrong.,1
Any AuthRight who believes this meme is retarded. Biden is a member of the Progressive religion even if he’s not as devout as AOC. Trump is not. This is THE dividing line.,3
I think it’s the fact that Kamala Harris is much more left wing compared to Pence/Trump.,3
"I'm not worried about Biden but Kamala does raise some questions. Isn't she a publicly admitted communist?",1
Bernard "Litteraly Stalin" Sanders,2
Radical centrist Hitler,3

“Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism as I understand it.”\n\n- George Orwell.\n\n\nTotally lib right,0

"Blue+Red=Pruple\n\nI don't see a problem",1
Nah hitler is full auth left according to American conservatives right next to Bernie.,2
Actually I don\'t think American Conservatives know the concept of "libertarianism and authoritarianism". They think more one-dimmentionaly. Or it is straight up rightist or leftist.,3
ANCAP TRUMP\n\nANCAP TRUMP,0
I feel like Jesus CNN and Obama are in the correct places,1
Boomers can’t comprehend that they’re not libertarian,1

"I might have to reconsider my flair cuz that's fucking epic.",3
"And shit while we're at it let's bring back real blood sports and then merchandise the shit outa it.",1
Hell yes this is my attitude and has been for years. We know half of them are doing it anyway. Why not two separate categories?,1
"I've said for years we need another olympics where steroid use is encouraged. I want to see an 8 foot tall chinese man with a life expectancy of 6 months throw a javelin into low orbit while a 500 pound Russian woman does the hammer throw with one pinky.",1
"Isn't that just normal olympics?",0
This but unironically,1
"This sounds fun but the poor sods would have so many health complications itd be crazy. We're talking muscles falling apart bones turning to dust liver failure heart failure brain damage all sorts. \nAnd you can be like 'well it's their choice' but is it really? Because you know that nobody is gonna be watching the Olympics if the mega-roid-olympics are on. So every talented athlete either retires or signs up to be experimented on. That's not a fair choice. And I don't want to be in a society where it is one honestly.",0
Hell yeah,0
that is unironically something I want to see,1
"This one's always been in my top 5 conversation topics while high",1
I\'d dig this. I\'d also dig an event where different companies develop "humanoid" robots to see how effectively we can make machines do the olympic events. A true "robot olympics" if you will.,3
"A problem may be on the dosage and the temper of the competitors. You don't want a guy on meth ripping your eyes out 'cause you didn't score that point lol",1
This... Except instead of playing for countries they play on behalf of their corporate sponsor.  Let’s see Nike Coke and Papa Johns battling it out for most endorsed player medals.,1
Do this but give out the metals 7 days later just to make sure they won’t immediately die from a coke overdose,0
We call this the Olympia. Average competitor life span is like 40-45 I think.,1
lol I just turned in my comment last week for law review: 40 pages on why PEDs should be legal and allowed in professional sports. I feel attacked.,1

Imagine the return on that stuff.\n\nIt shall be televised and sponsored by all major drug companies sports and gear companies. And that company will then be quoted in the stock market so that every average Joe can take a part and invest in it.",1
Honestly that answer is "Really high" but you can\'t know how high that is because your body is preventing you from using it\'s full potential to protect itself and reserve it for emergencies.\n\nYou\'d need to give them steroids to train that base strength up then give them a good deal of adrenaline maybe local anesthetics for the pain. Probably test how good they can handle the drugs for the performance day maybe something to enhance their focus too so they can actually *do* stuff not just overdose in the stadium. \n\nAfter that they\'ll need an ice bath and a medical checkup because their muscles will be fucked bones possibly broken limbs still numb organs needing a flush and hopefully beforehand you gave them something to help those drugs get out faster. You\'re pushing people\'s bodies to the absolute limit you\'re gonna be treating them like race cars. You better prepare for those tires to blow out at minimum.,0
Legalize Gladiator Games!!,1
finally a sport I could be good at,0
It was called ww2. The German army was on meth. The blitzkrieg was blitzed.,3

Is this murders specifically or also all people the cops kill?,0
I do like how you put the image even off the grid itself,3
What the fuck is this fake bullshit.\n\nPolice make up .27% of and (2018) committed 390 out of 16 214 murders in the united states.  That is 2.4% which is certainly over-represented (even though their JOB is to stop crime) but is no-where near the 12/50 this is trying to bitch about.,1
Brought to you by the same statisticians that call three gang members dying in a bad drug deal a mass shooting.,3
Yes thats their job. Thats what we pay them to do.\n\nTo shoot all of the ni- criminals.,3
Murder is different from homicide actually. They\'re not synonymous terms.\n\nWhen a cop kills a violent criminal I would say "Good job" and the court says it was justified.,2

> the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another. \n\nAnd because 99% of the time cops kill lawfully hardly any of that 8% is actually murder,3
uh buh gig wha .... huh but b but \n\n\nUhhhhhhhh\n\n\n\n#DESPITE MAKING UP JUST 13% OF THE POPULATION,3
I don’t understand why that is surprising. Cops walk around with guns. It is their job to stop crime. Is the guy that tweeted that implying that murder is always bad?,1
A cop is 18.5x more likely to be killed by a black man the he is to kill a black.,1
Despite making up 98.86% of the population in Poland normal whites were still being picked on by games journalists because the Witcher 3 didn\'t have black people. The videogame based on polish mythology in the middle ages didn\'t have black people "oh noooouu",1

Wow I’ve not found myself hating the majority of the comments on a post in this subreddit before.,0
"dude it's alright I'm not homophobic I have a gay friend",0
The comments are a fucking ride,3
No true auth right would ever claim to not have something against gays...,3

the authright one is a good thing.,3
~60% income tax only makes me trigger happy.,1
Why on earth would the be uncomfortable?\n\nI challenge you to find an authleft who is for gun control,2
Oh we definitely recognize it but the division is whether we’re pro-Islam or not. I’m personally don’t mind them as I think we should work to our own races’ and cultures’ preservation and Islam can do it by itself. But it becomes a problem when it reaches other lands with cultures that are contradictory to Islam and would need to be watered down or destroyed entirely to accommodate for the Islamic faith.,3
Thanks I hate it.,1
Actually communists are extremely pro gun,0

i believe that every citizen has the right to military grade automatic assault weapons. if you believe otherwise i just think that’s really pathetic and means you’re probably weak and passive,2
How is "Marx was pro-guns"  uncomfortable truth?,2
"free" lol,1
Self reported happiness statistics are utterly meaningless. If I have to explain why the conversation isnt worth having,1
Since when is authleft anti gun?,2
You are like two layers of deep fried memes behind if you think auth right hasn’t come to terms with the reality of both sharing the principles and hating people that are br- Islamists.,3
most authleftists are pro gun,2
I don’t know any marxists that are anti gun I don’t know why that quadrant would have a problem with this,2
Marx advocated packing heat and packing schmeat,2
Never heard an auth left be uncomfortable with guns,0
‘Islam agrees auth AuthRight’ is also an uncomfortable truth for LibLeft.,3

Tell me the place. I wont just let that leftist villagers take what is mine.,1
It’s been 80 days. How’s the watermelon patch?,0
To make this more realistic:\n\nAuthleft should get it\'s water rationed to once a week. If any one plant grows too quickly it should be cut back to be even with the others.\n\nAuthright should get only holy water and any off looking watermelons should be purged. A small picket fence should surround this patch.\n\nLibleft should be a mix of several strains of melon one or more melons should have a dick sized hole in it for reasons.\n\nLibright you should hire a minimum wage laborer to tend to this patch. Sell these melons at the farmers market as "organic GMO free" and charge twice what everyone else charges.,1

Watermelon patch that’s awesome,3
For the auth lefts not in the know watermelons are type of food food is what the rest of us put in our mouths when we are hungry very similar to the sawdust you guys eat but more enjoyable,1
We should seize the watermelon and redistribute equally to all quadrants,2
Remember when LibLeft told us a vote for Jo Jergensen was a vote for Trump and AuthRight and us laughed at them? Good times!,1
Kanye West has become the president\n\n**November 4th 2020**\n\nAgainst all odds Kanye West has won the presidency through the sheer power of his fanboys/girls and his new release "Like a President ft. LonelyIsland".\n\nAs the day comes to an end many news outlets speculate on his policies replaying old clips of comedic and nonsensical things.\n\n-\t- - \n\n**November 7th 2020**\n\nKanye West has completely shut the borders no one in no one out under the guise of coronavirus containment research begins on a method of obscuring the united states.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**February 1st 2021**\n\nBy now people are wondering what Kanye’s grand plan is a few memes have broken out comparing the situation to Wakanda but no one bats an eye.\n\nThe right doesn’t care what he does as the economy is booming thanks to kanye practically resurrecting the economy with his new merch “U.S. Freedom Bonds”.\n\nNo one knows how they’re made but owning just one makes you feel incredibly powerful as though you were young again.\n\nHowever Kanye only sells them in small batches.\n\nDue to this billionaires have invested upwards of trillions of dollars into making sure they get their hands on love bonds with the US government being the only one who has any idea what they’re made out of causing counterfeits and copycats to be laughable.\n\nThe Left lets him do what he wants as he recently came out as gay polyamorous and even discovered a new sexuality his male partner Tyler Demetri Joonies is an astrophysicist in the year 2054 even though Kanye has not met him he pronounces his love to him and comes out as the first Futur-sexual.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**December 25th 2021**\n\nThe U.S. has completely paid off their debt to china healthcare is free not because Kanye set up an elaborate social net to catch people who can’t afford insurance but because his Freedom Bonds earned so much money that hospitals have enough money to run at full capacity for 300 years.\n\nResearch into methods of turning the US invisible are still ongoing but with promising results.\n\nA rich business man named [REDACTED] managed to smuggle a Freedom Bond out of the US through his private yacht.\n\nTo his surprise as soon as he reached international waters the bond lost its brilliant color and he no longer felt young in fact he felt as though he was older than he was.\n\nHe begins plans to fund the reverse engineering of a freedom bond.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**July 4th 2022**\n\nPresident Kanye has withdrawn all military troops auxiliary or otherwise stating that “The United States have become too disconnected on a global scale to continue these dangerous war games”\n\nDespite what seems to be a sudden withdrawing of troops there are no insurrections and the middle east has miraculously become more stable.\n\nFreedom.Inc established to reverse engineer freedom bonds has made significant progress although it is unable to determine the makeup they conclude that they are made with 100% Local Materials hence why they don’t work outside of the US.\n\nKanye declares that the project to close off america via “an invisibility cloak” has concluded with less than satisfactory results.\n\nWill instead be funding Clean Nuclear Energy.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**April 17th 2023**\n\nNuclear Power Plants have popped up across the nation adding free electricity and utilities to the benefits of being an American alongside healthcare simply because electricity is so cheap that it costs more to withhold it than it does to let everyone have it.\n\nFreedom Inc have discovered the secret behind the legendary Freedom Bonds its the will of the American People.\n\nUsing an energized form of the American “Spirit” Kanye was able to create mythical bonds which restore vigor to anyone they suspect he harvests it during his numerous rallies and tours.\n\nEveryone outside of America has been declared a 1st-ish world country with many people rich and poor alike clamoring to be let in.\n\nEveryone is proud of anything slightly close to America clothes and appliances rumored to be made in america (since america exports nothing) are regarded as rare collectibles similar to a beatles record.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**August 29th 2023**\n\nKanye’s first term is beginning to end but everyone knows that a re-election would be a landslide America is positively glowing and even has China owing them vast sums of money.\n\nFreedom Bonds only get stronger as the american spirit is raised higher and higher by their enigmatic leader but replications are unsuccessful.\n\nIn an effort to combat him the Democrats and the Republicans have merged into one party the Republicrats even with this they stand no chance.\n\nThe whole world envied America but soon things would change Kanye had been watching Black Panther everyday since his presidency and he knew he needed a way to block America off from the world.\n\nLuckily there were a massive amount of nuclear power plants sitting around the country.\n\nKanye had a plan.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 21st 2024**\n\nConsidering the circumstances it was actually a tossup as to who would win the presidency with the Republicrats running on a direct yet split platform.\n\nAs though they had been frankenstiened together their policies were a mix between far left and far right. \n\nSurprisingly 40% loved it.\n\nHowever Kanye had an ace up his sleeve.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 23rd 2024**\n\nMillions of powerplants across the nation had malfunctioned practically erupting in radiation with the estimated death tolls to be somewhere in the real of 4 million.\n\nKanye responded like a hardened president containing the disasters safeproofing the unaffected plants and launching an investigation into what caused the disaster. \n\nTo the rest of the world the US had exploded with reported deaths of 100 million.\n\nAmerica went from being the 1st world country to a 3rd world country overnight.\n\nSpecial clearance was needed to even fly over the once glorious states and you can forget about landing a select few representatives were chosen to brave the dangers of the US each country sending them with methods to resist the radiation which had surely overtaken the land.\n\nBut to the Americans nothing of that scale happened. \n\nKanye had it controlled so well it was almost as though he had prepared specifically for this.\n\nTruthfully only around 500k people died most being prisoners or so elderly that even freedom bonds couldn’t preserve them for much longer.\n\nThe investigation finished arresting prominent members of the Republicrats Party for orchestrating a coup.\n\nKanye had achieved his Wakanda and he still had 4 more years to be president.\n\nThis truly is the best timeline.,0

I’m choking authright because they didn’t vote for my candidate. Trumps votes cost JoJo the election. If authright would’ve voted for my candidate we would’ve won. This is entirely authrights fault that we’re stuck with a dementia patient for the next few weeks as president.,1

"I really hate when people tell me I need to vote and then complain when I am not voting their color.   there should be a libertarian vote PSA   \n\n\nPerson : Voting is a civic right and important.

Why would you vote libertarian in a swing state,1

Now the next Republican has to appeal to the libertarians and put more libertarian ideas in there campaign to get more of the golden vote,1
"I've seen literally no one upset about this\n\n[I am wrong apparently](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/jo5ah7/good_job_libertarians/) though that one is pretty funny",3
Ahhh crap. Wanted to watch liberal tears.\n\nSeeing the trumpites spaz out on lolberts on 4chan will do as a replacement. "hurrr you shills landed the victory to Joo and republicans would give you more freedums"... seriously why the US elections are awfully similar to two used car salesmen trying to sell you their decrepit shit?,2

If you never left reddit youd think bernie was half way to a socialist utopia,3
"Man! How did bernie lose?!? Every single post about him had 100 awards. Shouldn't he win by default if he gets enough upvotes its the same thing right?",3
r/all thinks the compass is just a straight line left to right,1
Well...I’ll fire up the grill I guess,0
"ill dissagree slightly and say that America's libright is ubiquely radical.  Most countries dont have a libertarian time period or at least one that was good.\n\nsome american libertarians think the Civil Rights acts were good on voting but bad on free association.\n\nmost librights are also pro-union which on the right has   sometimes been seen as leftybootlicking even tho *wed also support right to work laws*\n\nwhether or not you think that or not not 100% loving the civil rights act and being vocal about it isnt a usually something you hear too often from a libertarian perspective and loving unions is considered strange by all conservatives i know.\n\nyou also see people who hate Lincoln for his domestic policy and that ending slavery and winning the war(debateable) are his only two good points. Not even most authrights hate Lincoln at all.\n\n*for the record i agree mostly with my examples\n\n\nedit: prounion as in they should exist but the balance of rights between union and corporation should be kept also public unions suck.",1
wtf i love authcenter now,2
Reddit is a black hole of hate. Ive never met so many people so ready to be pissed off before joining reddit,1
 I’m a left extremist then lol,0
The center is all relative. Like in the 1890s legal divorce and interracial marriage were far left of center positions. In Saudi Arabia letting women drive or own property is left of center.,1
Man there seems to be a lot of arguing in this thread over what "truly" counts as left/right wing. It\'s almost like political compasses aren\'t that helpful at actually defining political positions,0
[https://politicalcompass.org/uselection2016](https://politicalcompass.org/uselection2016),0
The meta-compass era has started,2
Do you really think its skewed to the right?,3
With the dumbass Bernie subs you’d think r/all was a little bit more authoritarian with how much they hate wealthy people.,0
Lol no\n\nI wish,0
"It\'s so hard to believe how far behind the US is in regard to___"\n\nfuck you.,1
Next week on facebook: "Lets stop paying federal taxes they can\'t stop all of us!" Organized by Jeb Bush,1
"Now clap. I\'m no longer saying please.",1
Wtf I love Jeb now,1
Thank you Jeb! very cool,1
"U know where there's no taxes? North Korea. Checkmate libs",2
I’ve never heard libleft be against taxes.,1
Finally the true feelings of LibLeft on taxes revealed,1
"Crypto currency is how we finally push back against the federal reserve and the international banking cartel. In the future you will borrow money against your bitcoin to buy a house and get paid directly in Monero for your employment income and day to day spending. \n  \nRon Paul is only half right. He goes after the centralized banks just like American hero and patriot Thomas Jefferson. The problem is the gold standard is its already controlled by foriegners. \n\nCrypto currency alternatively is mined using computer processing power and so it's fair. It doesn't require us to violate the non aggression principle to exploit third world countries for gold and diamonds or oil for example.",3
"Jeb that's were your wrong they'll just go into more debt",1
Holy crap a Bush with a good idea. Way to go Jeb.,0
"Based\n\nI'm furiously clapping now\n\nMy hands are becoming sore and bruised.\nMy skin is starting to peel and still I have no intention of stopping.\n\nJeb had once asked me to clap and I scoffed at him now Jeb is no longer saying please.",0
Jeb is ascending.,1
That is why people and the government have savings. LibRight has no savings?! Perhaps if you audited everyone then you could afford 1 month of tax delay. ;),2
2017...Was that Jebs atempt at coup?,1
meh theyd just turn on the money printers,1
Money printer goes brrrrr,1
"I like how lib left is secretly smiling. Remember y'all taxes are theft but so is profit",0
Based and jebpilled,3
But lib left wants to pay more taxes (free healthcare),3
I like roads bridges and hospitals,0
Oh man im high and this has been making laugh for the 20 minutes.\nStill ultra based.,1
Is this real? Had no idea he was lib!,1
So? The government can’t afford itself now.,1
"Really the only difference between LibLeft and LibRight when it comes to this matter is that one doesn't believe in taxes and the other believes only the rich should pay taxes. \n\nI'm sure if we experimented with the exact threshold we could reach compromise somewhere.",0
We fucked up \n\nJeb 2016,3
I’ve been saying the easiest way to destroy the US is to just stop paying taxes as a group. What’re they going to do throw people in debtors’ prisons? US prisons are profitable hellholes so they couldn’t handle a bulk of society that also refuses to work to fund their incarceration. Which either leaves unpunished tax evasion (which catches on) or death penalty for tax evaders. The left don’t believe in the death penalty and the right doesn’t believe in paying taxes so it wouldn’t be popular and cause discord among the populace.\n\n\nI mean I don’t believe the destruction of US society is a good idea but hey. It’s an option.,2
JEB JEB JEB JEB JEB,0
Italy be like,0
Jeb is becoming too powerful,1
>No taxes=no goverment\n\n>No goverment=no police to protect rich fucks\n\nYou sure you wanna do this librigh?,0
Is that real?,1
I mean he isn’t wrong,2
"I think they'll be just fine with Tesla and Amazon lobbying them",0
Why thank you,3
Was he lucid during this tweet?  In no way is he even slightly libertarian. \n\n*Please clap...*,1
Lol whoever goes first we’ll see how it goes! :P,3
"Semi based libleft: if we taxed billionaires there would be enough for a welfare network.  \n  \nActual based libleft: if companies were owned by the workers in them and they were also unified by unions that didn't suck companies and unions could afford to pay for Healthcare education guns and a free puppy.",0
