Also it seems like I just began to write a wall of text to explain the libleft position on those 3 words so I guess the meme was accurate with all its imperfection because the meme ask a definition of the political value with only one  word that could mean basicaly anything depending of the interpretation we make. The fact is that the libleft inpretation of those words is more true and more useful that the one each other quadrant use. the concept of liberty for exemple in the libright interpretation, would be more accurately described as the dictatorship of the capital because the liberty they defend is based on the value of the property each person possesses, as such the interest of those who own nothing would not be respected and only those who can use their capital will rightfully influence the way society work in this paradigm, thus the level of liberty each person enjoy would vary according to their relative wealth so tbe less wealthy would not have the same liberty that the rich would enjoy. liberty without equality is the tyrany of the powerful. Secondly the order autright defend is, in fact, chaos. The autright claim that their subjective perspective of what normality should be the eternal order and they never acknoledge that their idea doesnt correspond to reality and thus the "order" they create always have to fight against the reality that the world doesnt comply with the delusion they live in,  because of the idea that they protect   their order against the true order in which every progressive movement strive toward, they create and entertain the dialectical struggle between reality and the illusion of a pure tradition, creating chaos, a struggle between the old and the new and a war between reality and the narative that keep them in power. A true order would be to accept and evolve with the world and its diversity rather than to fight for the violent dominion of one\'s subjective archetype over the other. In fact, Anarchy is order! damn I\'m tired please for the rest imagined that I continue my rant by explaining how equality need freedom to be useful and that equality alone without taking needs into account contradictory and that only free and equal access to the means and the fruits of production is can bring a more healthy type of equality. to conclude not only is liberty, order and equality not contradictory they have to evolve in unity with one another to realy bring the best of each concept and the libleft position is the only that acknowledge and impleament them as such. The Autright oppose Progress with Order and only create Chaos. The Libright oppose Equality with Liberty and Autleft oppose Liberty with Equality and both can only create Tyrany. Only with libleft   can Liberty and Equality, Anarchy and communism, colaborate and thrive, and bring true Order by evolving with the world instead of opposing it.')

('Libertarian Left', 'Kanye West has become the president\n\n**November 4th, 2020**\n\nAgainst all odds, Kanye West has won the presidency through the sheer power of his fanboys/girls and his new release "Like a President ft. LonelyIsland".\n\nAs the day comes to an end, many news outlets speculate on his policies, replaying old clips of comedic and nonsensical things.\n\n-\t- - \n\n**November 7th, 2020**\n\nKanye West has completely shut the borders, no one in, no one out, under the guise of coronavirus containment, research begins on a method of obscuring the united states.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**February 1st, 2021**\n\nBy now people are wondering what Kanye�s grand plan is, a few memes have broken out, comparing the situation to Wakanda, but no one bats an eye.\n\nThe right doesn�t care what he does, as the economy is booming thanks to kanye practically resurrecting the economy with his new merch �U.S. Freedom Bonds�.\n\nNo one knows how they�re made, but owning just one makes you feel incredibly powerful, as though you were young again.\n\nHowever, Kanye only sells them in small batches.\n\nDue to this, billionaires have invested upwards of trillions of dollars into making sure they get their hands on love bonds, with the US government being the only one who has any idea what they�re made out of, causing counterfeits and copycats to be laughable.\n\nThe Left lets him do what he wants as he recently came out as gay, polyamorous, and even discovered a new sexuality, his male partner, Tyler Demetri Joonies, is an astrophysicist in the year 2054, even though Kanye has not met him, he pronounces his love to him and comes out as the first Futur-sexual.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**December 25th, 2021**\n\nThe U.S. has completely paid off their debt to china, healthcare is free not because Kanye set up an elaborate social net to catch people who can�t afford insurance, but because his Freedom Bonds earned so much money that hospitals have enough money to run at full capacity for 300 years.\n\nResearch into methods of turning the US invisible are still ongoing, but with promising results.\n\nA rich business man named [REDACTED] managed to smuggle a Freedom Bond out of the US, through his private yacht.\n\nTo his surprise, as soon as he reached international waters the bond lost its brilliant color, and he no longer felt young, in fact, he felt as though he was older than he was.\n\nHe begins plans to fund the reverse engineering of a freedom bond.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**July 4th, 2022**\n\nPresident Kanye has withdrawn all military troops, auxiliary or otherwise, stating that �The United States have become too disconnected on a global scale to continue these dangerous war games�\n\nDespite what seems to be a sudden withdrawing of troops, there are no insurrections, and the middle east has miraculously become more stable.\n\nFreedom.Inc, established to reverse engineer freedom bonds, has made significant progress, although it is unable to determine the makeup, they conclude that they are made with 100% Local Materials, hence why they don�t work outside of the US.\n\nKanye declares that the project to close off america via �an invisibility cloak� has concluded, with less than satisfactory results.\n\nWill instead be funding Clean Nuclear Energy.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**April 17th, 2023**\n\nNuclear Power Plants have popped up across the nation, adding free electricity and utilities to the benefits of being an American, alongside healthcare, simply because electricity is so cheap that it costs more to withhold it than it does to let everyone have it.\n\nFreedom Inc have discovered the secret behind the legendary Freedom Bonds, its the will of the American People.\n\nUsing an energized form of the American �Spirit� Kanye was able to create mythical bonds which restore vigor to anyone, they suspect he harvests it during his numerous rallies and tours.\n\nEveryone outside of America has been declared a 1st-ish world country, with many people, rich and poor alike, clamoring to be let in.\n\nEveryone is proud of anything slightly close to America, clothes and appliances rumored to be made in america (since america exports nothing) are regarded as rare collectibles, similar to a beatles record.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**August 29th, 2023**\n\nKanye�s first term is beginning to end, but everyone knows that a re-election would be a landslide, America is positively glowing, and even has China owing them vast sums of money.\n\nFreedom Bonds only get stronger as the american spirit is raised higher and higher by their enigmatic leader, but replications are unsuccessful.\n\nIn an effort to combat him, the Democrats and the Republicans have merged into one party, the Republicrats, even with this, they stand no chance.\n\nThe whole world envied America, but soon, things would change, Kanye had been watching Black Panther everyday since his presidency, and he knew he needed a way to block America off from the world.\n\nLuckily, there were a massive amount of nuclear power plants sitting around the country.\n\nKanye had a plan.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 21st, 2024**\n\nConsidering the circumstances, it was actually a tossup as to who would win the presidency, with the Republicrats running on a direct, yet split platform.\n\nAs though they had been frankenstiened together, their policies were a mix between far left and far right. \n\nSurprisingly, 40% loved it.\n\nHowever, Kanye had an ace up his sleeve.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 23rd, 2024**\n\nMillions of powerplants across the nation had malfunctioned, practically erupting in radiation, with the estimated death tolls to be somewhere in the real of 4 million.\n\nKanye responded like a hardened president, containing the disasters, safeproofing the unaffected plants, and launching an investigation into what caused the disaster. \n\nTo the rest of the world, the US had exploded, with reported deaths of 100 million.\n\nAmerica went from being the 1st world country to a 3rd world country overnight.\n\nSpecial clearance was needed to even fly over the once glorious states, and you can forget about landing, a select few representatives were chosen to brave the dangers of the US, each country sending them with methods to resist the radiation which had surely overtaken the land.\n\nBut, to the Americans, nothing of that scale happened. \n\nKanye had it controlled so well it was almost as though he had prepared specifically for this.\n\nTruthfully, only around 500k people died, most being prisoners or so elderly that even freedom bonds couldn�t preserve them for much longer.\n\nThe investigation finished, arresting prominent members of the Republicrats Party for orchestrating a coup.\n\nKanye had achieved his Wakanda, and he still had 4 more years to be president.\n\nThis truly is the best timeline.')

Unfortunately we had already bought the apparatus from another friend of the mayor for 100x market rate. So now we are paying another friend of the mayor above market rate to store the apparatus in their warehouse while we figure out what to do with it (probably sell it for scraps to another friend of the mayor at below market rate). \n\nIn all we have spent $400,000,000 on the new park which consists of a field and a bench.

Most of these people aren't entering through the southern border and there aren't ships dumping people off on a daily basis. So I think it would be reasonable to guess the number of visa overstays are much higher up north when compared to southern border states.

My employer would make a profit on my labor up to $100k before my cost would outpace my production. The ZOPA is 50k-100k If the wage agreed upon is $70, I pocket $20k and my producer pockets $30k. How does one come to the $70k figure? Competition. \n\nPerhaps I can get jobs elsewhere that pay me more, say 65k? I�d take that job instead, so the employer has to pay me more than the $50k to get my labor because he has to beat 65k. He offers me $70 and still pockets 30k though, and he is happy. Why can�t I charge my employer 100k? After all, he�d be willing to pay it. Well, turns out other people would be willing to work for less than 100k. 80k is as low as they�d go. I therefore have to undercut the labor supply by going with 70k and I still pocket 20k in surplus above my minimum. I�m still happy.

In the show, they bought one from some dude and it did show the machine was rigged by a decent percentage. And in these close elections such as Bush vs Gore or Trump vs Biden, a few counties can change the whole state, and thus swing a close election. I think our election systems should be redone tbh. \n\n\n\nAdd to that the issue sbout the Times magazine publishing an article about the "Secret Cabal that secured the 2020 election", by changing the laws and shit. My biggest issue with the 2020 US election laws is that state courts haven\'t accepted the hearings about the unconstitutional pandemic voting laws before the election because there was no harmed party yet, and then they haven\'t accepted hearings after the election because the election had already passed. So the 2020 election was definitely rigged to an extent, and the debate should be where there has been cheating and how important it was. \n\n\n\n\nI don\'t get either why people would be against research on such topics. If the election wasn\'t rigged, why would Trump haters be so vocal about not doing a commission about it?

This racial disparity in time spent wrongfully incarcerated holds true across different types of convictions.\n\nBlack people tend to receive harsher sentences when accused of sexual assault, and have a harder time being exonerated from a wrongful conviction. On average, they spend 4.5 more years in prison than their white counterparts before being exonerated.\n\nBlack people wrongly convicted of murder spend an average of three more years in prison than white people � four if they are on death row. Innocent Black people spend an average of 16 years on death row before they are exonerated.\n\nAbout one-third of unarmed people killed by police are Black.\nOf the more than 149 unarmed people killed by the police in 2017, 49 were Black, according to Mapping Police Violence.\n\nDespite thousands of police shootings since 2005, only 110 officers who shot a person while on duty have been charged with murder or manslaughter, FiveThirtyEight reported. And less than half of them were convicted. Too often officers who use excessive force or engage in misconduct return to their jobs without consequence. This lack of accountability can lead to wrongful convictions. \n\nAccording to the National Registry of Exonerations, cases of Black people exonerated from wrongful murder convictions were 22% more likely to involve police misconduct than similar cases involving white defendants.\n\nIn Illinois, for example, under former Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge, police psychologically abused and physically tortured more than 100 Black men and women until many falsely confessed to crimes they did not commit.

After black people were freed from slavery in the 1860s, the appropriate things necessary to bring black people on the same level as white people was not done. This left black people in a state of abject poverty that they remain in to this day, entirely not of their own fault. \n\nAnd it's the same thing with violence. When people are poor, that causes them to have to commit acts of violence and legality in order to survive; and when you have a society full of people who have to do such things, that just causes the society to become nothing more than a cesspool of crime.")

If anything I\'d consider things like resisting corporate and government surveillance to be more of a conservative ideology even if it fits well into the Libertarian side of the compass. And I would say that Orange Libleft is both progressive *and* incredibly controlling. Hating all straight people is no different from hating all gay people, and wishing for legislation in the government to provide advantages or disadvantages to one or the other seems pretty controlling.\n\nSure plenty of authcenters aren\'t progressive, but the woke crowd seems to fit pretty strongly into both categories.\n\n> Yes because nazism is close to left ideology.\n\nHonestly I hear so many people say nazism is far right that I\'m surprised to hear someone say this. I agree with you in the most basic sense considering I consider nazism to be authcenter which is close to authleft, but I think nazis are very much so authcenter and authlefts that show those qualities are more authcenter than they are authleft.\n\n> Nah they re mostly lib right. Librights mostly don�t believe in government law.\n\nAnarcho-capitalism is a thing sure, but that in no way describes most librights. I tend to think anarchism is libcenter instead of libleft due to anarcho-capitalism being far libright and anarcho-communism being far libleft, but this might just be our different interpretations of the compass. Still I would say most librights believe in government law to some extent, just believing that those laws should protect personal property and basically anything else under the NAP (with ancaps believing that such protections should also be private).\n\nI don\'t know if we\'ll really come to an agreement here since our interpretations of the groundwork seem to be pretty far apart, but your perspective is interesting nonetheless and I should clarify I\'m coming from a place of curiosity.')

However, it is also possible to hold that view but to also believe that if a person is putting others in danger and intends to kill them, then if the only way is to kill them first, then it is unfortunately the best option. That might be someone assaulting you, it might be a pregnancy with the likely outcome of the mother's death. There are few pro-lifers (that I know, and I know a lot) who think that if the mother is *going to die* because of the pregnancy, and an abortion would literally save her life, then it is an unfortunate solution but the solution to apply. The real upset starts when people perform abortions on healthy mothers with no abnormal risks. \n\n>Also, raising children is one of the most important things a human can do. It should always be on purpose and with the child�s best interest at heart.\n\nVery often people become pregnant and becoming a good parent isn�t possible.\n\nYes, which is why people should fund adoption centers to be more effective and helpful, and why sexual education should be more ingrained. While *technically*, abstinence until you *want* to have a baby is the *best* way to avoid unwanted pregnancy, it's just facts that people are gonna screw regardless of the risks. So informative, practical sexual education is important. Not one that encourages promiscuity, but one that counsels caution. \n\nI�m opposed to people being stuck in that situation and if there�s a safe effective way for them not to be then I support it.

Its literally used for dehumanizing the developing human to dismiss the concerns. Dont pretend that isn\'t true. \n\nMy personal opinion on this issue is that there is no good answer to it. Two sets of rights are clashing. Unfortunately, both sides hide behind ridiculous false equivalences and straw man eachothers arguments.

('Libertarian Left', "I'm libleft, so there's two things I have to keep in mind, when considering any law:\n\n1) Does this benefit people/the community while devolving power to the individual/the community?\n\n2) How will the law operate in the real world?\n\nThe first because that's my core philosophy, the second because progressive efforts to improve QoL tend to give power to central authority, thereby reducing QoL in the long-term.\n\nSo when I consider abortion, the first gives me a clear answer: abortion should be without restrictions, until the fetus becomes an individual. That's a complex question, and I'm not a neurologist, but the answer *seems* to be in the 20-35 week range. Since that's the only non-arbitrary means of deciding when a person becomes a person, any answer I give will be entirely dependent on where progress in developmental neurobiology takes us.\n\nThe second test is more involved, and requires a longer answer. Restrictions with exemptions generally put the onus on the actor to prove they meet the standards of the exemption. So exemptions for the life of the mother will rely on *proving* that the mother's life is in danger. Functionally, that'll result in a lot of doctors declining to intervene until the situation is critical, which is terrible medical practice, and has been shown to increase infant and maternal mortality. That is not acceptable. So, I'd place the onus on the *state* to prove that the mother's life was not only not at risk, but that no reasonable person could have believed her life was at risk. \n\nFurther, in cases of late-term abortion, the mother will want the pregnancy to come to term. She will likely already love the child the fetus will shortly become. She will also be intimately familiar with the medical histories of everyone involved. She will literally be the person best equipped to be the medical advocate for the fetus, which due to it's state of unconsciousness, will be incapacitated. I see no reason to second guess this person, as they make decisions on behalf of someone they love.\n\nSo, unless the state can prove that the above paragraph is not the case for someone who is having an abortion, I see no reason for that person's decisions to be thwarted.\n\nBasically, I wouldn't put restrictions on abortion.  I'd pass a law which criminalized intentionally aborting a viable fetus for malicious purposes: keep the burden on the state to prove that the intentions were not for the benefit of the health of the mother or to protect the fetus from suffering.")

('Libertarian Right', 'Excellent write up, I read it several times and agree with a lot of this, including both of your principles and aversion to centralized authority. A couple of points I struggle with though is the arbitrariness and subjective point the fetus �becomes and individual.� This seems to be a forever moving target as technology improves and neurologists disagree and learn new things. This means you inevitably will allow what may one day be considered murder. \n\nPerhaps this is simply an imperfection in an imperfect world but typically from a liberty perspective things like the blackstone formulation where it is better that 10 guilty go free than one innocent go to prison are ideal. Therefore I think the limit should be very low. In other words, if one hospital with top of the line equipment delivers a baby at 20 weeks for example and it survives, no abortion aside from the previously discussed exceptions should be allowed. \n\nOtherwise, you�d be accepting that some percent however small of them are being killed that otherwise could survive. Questions of improving QOL however are sticky since the entire debate is about whose life and when. This is further compounded by the fact that with the exception of rape you absolutely cannot become pregnant without taking an action you understand has this risk. So there is an issue at least for me in that the life was created voluntarily.\n\nIt reminds me of one time I heard someone say that god created everything so if he wants to kill us all he has the right to do so. I don�t believe that is true, if there is a god that created us he certainly can kill us and we have no recourse but it is not right to do so simply because he can or that he created us. Your second point I agree with completely, the onus should absolutely be on the state to prove rather than the other way around. That is the basis of our entire legal system, innocent until the state proves to a random sample of the population that they should be given the authority to take your rights. \n\nI�d even further say that since sometimes the process can be the punishment the state should be able to do nothing to you without ample evidence presented beforehand and perhaps even open themselves up to countersuit for damages in the event they do not render a conviction. I don�t know what the ripple effects of that would be as a result but that seems at first thought a good check against persecution through process alone. Anyway, interesting convo.')
('Libertarian Right', 'Calm down buddy. Obviously intent matters in law, we are well past an eye for an eye. Intent does not absolve you of responsibility however where you ought to know. Negligence is not given a pass because you didn�t know. I�m reminded of a parable that was in Carl Sagan�s book The Demon Haunted World. It was about a merchant who owns a ship that he used for years to trade his goods across the sea. One day a shipwright tells him that his ship is in badly need of an overhaul and will likely not make it another voyage. The merchant, not wanting to spend the money to fix the ship convinces himself that the shipwright does not know what he is talking about and just wants a customer. \n\nThat the ship has sailed many times and never had any issues. The next voyage the ship sank and all crew and cargo lost and the merchant collected the insurance money. The point being that the merchant is morally responsible in this case because despite believing he was right, he ought to have known. Likewise everyone knows that contraception is not 100% effective and you understand that risk. Your argument is akin to returning a losing lottery ticket because you intended to win and didn�t agree to lose. \n\nYou seem to think women are mindless dimwits that don�t understand the consequences of their actions.

I would say that when a doctor actually believes that it is either the mother or the child, then the mother should be able to make that choice, whether she want to continue living, or wants her child to live. I think that choice sucks, and personally if it was my wife, I would ask her to make the hard choice of killing the child so one of them could live. I would accept her answer if she chose the other way. Either way it would be terrible. However these types of emergencies are exceedingly rare, and usually a cesarean section would take away almost all risk to both people. Any mother who wouldn\'t risk a surgery to save her child\'s life should get her tubes tied.\n\nWhen chances are unknown, there are procedures, like cesareans which mitigate the risk.')

In recent decades they returned in their masses. Pioneers, ma'pilim [(Hebrew) - immigrants coming to Eretz-Israel in defiance of restrictive legislation] and defenders, they made deserts bloom, revived the Hebrew language, built villages and towns, and created a thriving community controlling its own economy and culture, loving peace but knowing how to defend itself, bringing the blessings of progress to all the country's inhabitants, and aspiring towards independent nationhood.\n\n> In the year 5657 (1897), at the summons of the spiritual father of the Jewish State, Theodore Herzl, the First Zionist Congress convened and proclaimed the right of the Jewish people to national rebirth in its own country.\n\n> This right was recognized in the Balfour Declaration of the 2nd November, 1917, and re-affirmed in the Mandate of the League of Nations which, in particular, gave international sanction to the historic connection between the Jewish people and Eretz-Israel and to the right of the Jewish people to rebuild its National Home.\n\n> The catastrophe which recently befell the Jewish people - the massacre of millions of Jews in Europe - was another clear demonstration of the urgency of solving the problem of its homelessness by re-establishing in Eretz-Israel the Jewish State, which would open the gates of the homeland wide to every Jew and confer upon the Jewish people the status of a fully privileged member of the comity of nations.\n\n> Survivors of the Nazi holocaust in Europe, as well as Jews from other parts of the world, continued to migrate to Eretz-Israel, undaunted by difficulties, restrictions and dangers, and never ceased to assert their right to a life of dignity, freedom and honest toil in their national homeland.\n\n> In the Second World War, the Jewish community of this country contributed its full share to the struggle of the freedom- and peace-loving nations against the forces of Nazi wickedness and, by the blood of its soldiers and its war effort, gained the right to be reckoned among the peoples who founded the United Nations.\n\n> On the 29th November, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a Jewish State in Eretz-Israel; the General Assembly required the inhabitants of Eretz-Israel to take such steps as were necessary on their part for the implementation of that resolution.

That doesn't mean the support was illegitimate. \n\nAnd lastly, why do you talk about the state of affairs previous to the euromaidan, and not after that or the current situation?. That would seem more relevant into if ukraine has shitty nazi ideas today and thus if we should support them today that dubious association smears on previous politicians and cherrypicked and missrepresented agreements, that were also already superceded by later agreements.\n\nI'll grant you some points, evidently USA had an interest in mantaining it's superpower monopoly, and thus it had an interest in trying to separate ukraine from russia, that does not mean ukrainians didn't share this interest as well, as most do today. It's also not the only state that does it, heck russian interference in elections round the world makes the news every saturday.\n\nBut what you presented right here is Russian propaganda, that much is clear. \n\nI do not know if you willingly constructed this argument yourself or just got convinced by the fallacies.

The myth that NATO promised not to expand east comes from a verbal agreement with no evidence that these verbal promises actually occurred, and HARD evidence that this "agreement" had no legal precedent.\n6. The fact that russia is invading Ukraine so they don\'t join NATO isn\'t some kind of conspiracy.

This would bring down Russia's Economy slowly, that's the objective. I never said that NATO wants to attack. This of course escalated when Putin decided to invade. Now why was Ukraine the last straw for the Russians? Ukraine has been providing Russia with weapons for decades, they made a pact in 1996, of non aggression too (that has been of course violated), in that pact Ukraine would have continued to provide weapons, as Ukraine is the MAIN, weapon manufacturer of Europe. By putting NATO's influence in Ukraine, Russia would have lost its last hope for power. Putin doesn't want to be second to the United States, he knows that NATO's strategy is in order to preserve their position as first military power in the world.  Russia would have lost a considerably large amount of it's power if Ukraine became part of NATO. Am I pro-Russian for stating that?

NATO (USA) wants to maintain their position of first world power. Russia doesn't want the US to be first, they want to maintain their power and wealth. Does it justify the invasion? No, but there is a historical retrospective we should point out. The Cuban Missile Crisis: when Castro took control of Cuba he became a vassal state of the Soviets, so they started building missile ramps, pointing them directly towards the USA. When the United States found out, they rightfully intervened. Now, try to flip the coin and see how basically every country that surrounds Russia has NATO bases pointed at them, would that justify an intervention in Ukraine? Ukraine has been providing Russia with weapons, they made a pact in 1996 for that. Of course Putin feels threatened. Putin in fact has been pointing it out to the international community for like 10 years, that Russia can't stand the pressure of NATO and that Ukraine had not to be touched. Yet, the US caused the revolutions in Ukraine specifically the Russian influence, that would have caused Russia to weaken without its weapons, and NATO's plan would have been successful...

By putting pressure on Russia, the Russians would feel constantly at threat and would spend more and more of their economy on defense and armaments. This would bring down Russia\'s Economy slowly, that\'s the objective.\n\nOkay, you recognise Nato never intended to attack, but then the russians felt pressured into investing in defense, if Russia knew NATO never intended to attack, why would it feel the need to invest in defense?\n\nAlso, how would this tank their economy exactly? This only implies more spending by the government, but the rest of the russian economy wouldn\'t be affected. To further proof USA is the top military spender in the world and their economy keeps growing and is also one of the better ones globally. It\'s a non sequitur.\n\nAlso, Russia\'s economy is not worrisome, it\'s GDP is about the same of spain a country with fewer resources, 1/10th of the population and one of the worse economies in the EU zone. That\'s no serious threat to any western country. \n\n>Now why was Ukraine the last straw for the Russians? Ukraine has been providing Russia with weapons for decades, they made a pact in 1996, of non aggression too (that has been of course violated), in that pact Ukraine would have continued to provide weapons, as Ukraine is the MAIN, weapon manufacturer of Europe. By putting NATO\'s influence in Ukraine, Russia would have lost its last hope for power.\n\nThe first part is patently false.\n\n[Weapons export ranking by country](https://www.army-technology.com/analysis/arms-exports-by-country/)\n\nAs you can see not only is Ukraine not on the list, it\'s also surpassed by multiple european countries such as Spain, France and Russia. Now if Russia is the 2 country which exports weapons it follows that they don\'t have a need for ukrainian weapons, as they have an abundant surplus that they can sell overseas. In fact most of ukraine\'s weaponry is from the USSR period or bought later from russia.\n\nSecondly, there was no risk of Ukraine entering NATO as it was amidst a civil war since 2014, and countries with ongoing conflicts cannot enter NATO (since this would pull all the alliance into said war). So it was not inminent association into NATO which triggered this attack. But you\'re right that putin couldn\'t let ukraine distance itself from russia if it was to remain a "superpower", I agree with that being the reason he tried to forcibly avoid that. \n\n>Am I pro-Russian for stating that? No. I simply acknowledge why that was one of the reasons Putin invaded, and not like most idiots who just believe that Putin one day woke up in a bad mood and invaded a sovereign country.\n\nNo, in fact that is what most well informed people agree on, they also recognise that it is shitty justification for invading a country, not legitimate at all, and thus makes putin the guilty part in this war. Also, to clear a point, I never said you were pro-Russian, but your discourse was russian propaganda, as it was filled with fallacies and cherrypicked data to smear both Ukraine and USA.\nThat much I believe has been proven in my previous comment. \n\n>I can\'t prove that Yuschenko is a neo Nazi, but what is interesting is that his wife has worked right besides of George W.

And more importantly how is any of that related to NATO? As far as i can understand, she worked for US congress, not NATO.\n\n>I am willing to make more posts about the situation in Ukraine, I know I only showed a few things about the Maidan Protests and went on a tangent to show NATO\'s objectives. It\'s a meme format, and on reddit, so I wanted to make it simple\n\nOkay, thats good I suppose it answers my question on why you do not focus on current ukraine, so I\'ll accept that answer.\n\nLet\'s recap the conclusions\n\n1 Nato never posed a real threat to russia, not offensively, and even if that did force them to invest in military, that wouldn\'t necesarely affect their ecconomy. \n\n2 Ukraine is not a major weapons exporter.\n\n3 Russia\'s reason for invasion is to forcibly avoid ukraine\'s alignment with the west, that\'s still a shitty reason.\n\nAlso, would appreciate if you addressed my previous counterpoints or if you disagree and based on what (do not feel compelled, I just like debating) either her or in dm if you\'d preffer. \n\nLastly, do not take this as an attack on your person, I just wanted to address these points as I have seen most of them repeatedly and wanted to offer the appropiate counterpoints. \n\nI understand that someone may be unconfident in ukraine political cleanliness let\'s say, it would be justified.

('Libertarian Right', ">Because Russia wants to stay a world power on par with the United States.\n\nBut that is irrelevant to wether NATO grows or not. That motive was there from the begining, ergo NATO growth would not affect it. \n\n\n>The United States makes money out of wars all over the world. Russia too, but not at as much as NATO, they managed to make many countries in Europe dependent on their resources, like gas especially. Look up at what's going on right now in Germany. They have been dependent on Russia for gas and is now in a very difficult position because the EU wanted to impose sanctions on them and stop the importation\n\nVarious points\n\n1. USA's growth has little to do with profitable wars (just see the percentage of the economy tied to military profits, I'd guess cinema is more responsible for said growth, at least hystorically). \n2. The dependency of germany and europe was achieved via diplomacy, not military. \n3. You didn't answer my main point, which was that an increment in military investment does not diminishes economic growth significantly (in fact you even argued the opposite, claiming wars were one of the main sources of revenue for both USA and russia)\n\n>Exactly, it's doing even better than the us as of now because of decisions like: trading their FIAT with a Gold Standard\n\nYou misunderstood, Russia's economy does not trouble  anyone, they may still be militarily top of the world (though doubtful, given their performance on ukraine) but economically they're very unconcerning. As said before it's the size of Spain which is one of the worst economies in EU zone, despite vastly more available resources and 10 times the population.\n\nAlso, as far as I am aware Russia did not return to gold standard, they rose interest rates up to 20%, forbid withdrawal of other currencies and increased demand of their coin by demanding payment with it. That only to avoid it's fall. Evidently rising interest up to 20% damages the economy. I haven't kept up on this, so I may be missing something.\n\n\n>That's interesting, I might reconsider my argument, I was pretty sure Ukraine has been one of the top leading weapon manufacturers in Europe. Except you're wrong, Ukraine is the 4th largest arms exporter. You should know how the Ukrainian oligarchs made very shady deals with the US government (especially someone related to the Biden family), they singlehandedly funded the Zelensky show and subsequently its election. These oligarchs are in coalition with the Biden family as a matter of fact. \n\nThen it would be nice if you had a source to back you up, otherwise you should at least try to refute mine, which you have not done\n\n[Arms export 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/267131/market-share-of-the-leadings-exporters-of-conventional-weapons/)\n\nI found this more recent that places ukraine 14th, behind UK, France, Italy, and others. \n\n>I don't understand what the specific roles in government these people have. What is certain is that NATO is the United States, and by working as an advisor and assistant to the president makes you 100% involved. Especially because she is the wife of the former Yuschenko, who was the main rival of the filo-russian president Yanukovych. That should tell you enough, I am very glad you ask all these questions, it's admirable. But to me it's pretty obvious that her role (and the others) was to take down the Russian president to further NATO's goals. \n\nI dunno, seems to me you are filling the gaps whit what is convenient to your story, but without that, it does not follow. \n\n>So what I am saying is that there's a lot of bias in the media. \n\nYeah, on that we agree.\n\n>I don't like to call it western propaganda, but it sure is a war fueling one backed by American corporations and government in order to push people into taking a side\n\nI think there are 2 factors. \n\n1. Ukraine and its allies are using this as propaganda (I mean this to say weaponized information towards a cause, irregardless of vericity). That is normal on ukraine's part, they're at a very desperate war and will use every conceivable method to garner support. \n2. This story sells like hot potatoes, so it is normal everyone chants it, as it sells very well. It has gone viral, and its not the only time this phenomenon has happened. \n\n>I don't like to call it western propaganda, but it sure is a war fueling one backed by American corporations and government in order to push people into taking a side. And what's better than a divided populace to subjugate the masses? It's a divide and conquer strategy, it keeps us numb and tribalistic. We should all recognize that in this war there are no good sides.\n\nI don't know, seems clear there is not any divisiveness, as you said mainstream supports ukraine, ukraine's support is overwhelming save few extremists and counterpositionists. So i do not think they are dividing, they are (or have, since at least in my country the war has gone down in the news) profitting off a viral narrative. Lastly, there is a pretty clear guilty party in not only the initiation but in the continuation of this war. If russia withdrew from ukraine this war would be over. \nSo unlike other wars it is clear which part is the victim and which the perpetrator. Does that mean ukraine's forces won't do some fucked up shit? Hell no. But they are the victim (this is undeniable).\n\n\n>Hey lastly, I may not answer to all your questions, you even might know more than I do. I admit my ignorance on many topics. And above all, I am grateful for the way you're talking to me, it's nice to listen to level headed people with critical thinking. Thank you\n\nNo worries mate, I commend you for being willing to discuss this calmly and to put forward your suspicions regarding this. It's very difficult to manifest dissent from the mainstream and moreso on this topic. \n\nIts been nice chatting with you. Have a nice day, mate.")

('Libertarian Right', 'An omnipotent deity cannot separate himself from his responsibility for what happens to the people he has created. Everything that ever happens only happens because the omnipotent deity allows it to happen. Human beings continue to exist because God allows them to exist. They have a sin nature because God allows them to have one. They go to hell because God allows it to happen.\n\nThe only scenario in which it is forgivable for an omnipotent deity to allow such atrocities is if they are *logically incompatible* with some greater good. And for the most part, the only greater good I\'ve ever seen proposed to justify hell and the human sin nature is the supposed greater good of free will.\n\nBut free will fails utterly at fulfilling this role, and it fails for a number of reasons. \n\n1. *Prioritizing free will over personal well-being to such an extreme degree goes against every human\'s basic moral intuitions.* For instance, suppose I tell my child not to play on the freeway. If he disobeys me and I stand idly by while he gets run over, thinking to myself, "He *chose* not to obey me. I cannot stand in the way of his choice.", that would make me an extremely irresponsible (and immoral) parent. What God does, by allowing people to go to hell (people who are usually unaware of the consequences when they sin), is orders of magnitude worse than that.\n2. *There is no evidence in the Bible to suggest that God actually values free will to this extreme degree.* God even goes out of his way to violate people\'s free will, as he did when he hardened Pharaoh\'s heart. The idea that God values free will to such an extreme degree that he allows hell and sin to exist as its cost - that idea is basically fanmade headcanon created to explain an apparent plot hole in the Bible.\n3. *Free will and the sin nature either exist in heaven or they don\'t.* If people who go to heaven have free will in heaven but do not sin, then the potential for sin was never necessary for free will. If people in heaven *don\'t* have free will, then that would suggest that God does not value free will over sinlessness after all. The only real way out of this quandary (without deviating from the heaven/hell paradigm) is to propose that God wants people to become sinless automatons, but he wants them to choose to become sinless automatons of their own free will. But that idea has problems of its own...\n4. *The choice to believe in Jesus cannot be a choice made of free will, because belief is not a choice.* Yes, you can choose to expose yourself to ideas and information that are likely to change your beliefs, but there\'s a limit to how much you can accomplish with that, and you never choose the beliefs themselves. If God told me that I had 24 hours to believe that the earth is flat, and that if I\'m not a flat-earther tomorrow, he\'d send me to hell for all eternity, I\'d be at a loss. I could *pretend* to be a flat-earther. I could go through the motions, and I could spout flat-earther dogma like no one\'s business, but no matter how hard I try, I simply am not capable of genuinely believing that the earth is flat. Other followers of this flat-earther God would say that *deep down* everyone knows that the earth is flat, and that flat-earth deniers are just too selfish or afraid to commit themselves to the flat-earther God. And there\'s nothing I could say to convince those people. But deep down everyone in this dystopian world who isn\'t a flat earther would know that their disbelief is genuine, contrary to what the followers of the flat-earther God say, and it\'s because the idea of a flat earth is just too implausible, given what we know about the universe.\n5. *A sin nature is not required for free will.* I do not have the desire to drink toilet water, and it is something I will likely never do in my life. I nonetheless have the freedom to drink toilet water, if I so choose. My distaste for toilet water is not somehow inhibiting my free will. Similarly, God could create human beings with an equal level of disgust at the idea of committing sin, and those human beings would be no less free. So it can\'t just be free will for which God allows sin natures and hell to exist. What can one say in God\'s defense, then? Well, perhaps, what God *actually* wants is not merely to be freely chosen, but he wants humans to *act against their natures* to choose him. On some level, this is understandable, since the most meaningful choices and expressions of love are those that are not in one\'s immediate best interest. The problem is that believing/accepting Christ costs nothing, so I would not truly consider it to be a real sacrifice or a meaningful choice in any way. (Sure, Christians will say that accepting salvation is supposed to be accompanied by a renewed dedication to following Jesus\'s example, but the works aren\'t what actually save you - what saves you is belief, and belief costs nothing.) You also don\'t escape problems #1, #2, or #4 with this altered justification.\n\nI just don\'t think some Christians appreciate how extreme of a claim it is to say that (1) there\'s an omnipotent deity who decided to create billions of people whose very nature is to act against him, (2) that eternal suffering is a justifiable response to created beings when they act in accordance with this nature that they had no hand in assigning to themselves, and (3) that this deity wants to withhold the punishment of eternal suffering but is for some reason unable or unwilling to do so for the majority of created beings. I\'ve seen some try to untie this knot into something that makes sense and is not morally reprehensible, but every attempt I\'ve witnessed falls painfully on its face.')

Anyone who accepts Christ into their heart is redeemed and allowed access into Heaven. Those who do not accept Christ choose sin and everything that happens as a result is their choice. Sin is like an anchor tied around your leg, and you\'re about to jump overboard on a ship. God says, "Wait! I have this key! Use it to take the anchor off so you won\'t sink and die!"

Sure, but take a look at how strenuously the right wing hates gays, trans people, atheists, Muslims, people who have premarital sex, I could go on. \n\nPopulations of extremely devout Christians have done truly terrible things in the name of their religion. The Inquisition, the Salem Witch Trials, the Crusades, various genocides (though often accidental while misguidedly attempting to bring religion to natives and "save" them). Other large groups of Christians have considered their actions *justified* by their religion rather than in service to it; the American pro-slavery movement frequently used passages from the Bible to prove that God finds slavery to be acceptable...and they were right, so long as they followed the biblical rules.\n\nAll of those people, millions of people, felt that they were obeying God\'s precepts. Most felt they were advancing his interests by killing girls who dance or wiping out tribes of heathens. As far as society has been concerned for near 2000 years, anything that is done in the name of God, so long as they believe it to be his will, is acceptable.\n\nWhich brings us back to hell. The billboard I mentioned exists to draw wayward adherents into the church. "Best come into church or you\'ll burn in hell for eternity!" It\'s common, too. You can tell a lot about a culture by its language, and the ubiquitous use of the term "hell" in ours would stand out to anyone as a cultural point. American Christian churches, particularly evangelical churches, are notorious for their frequent fire and brimstone sermons. \n\nBit of a meandering comment to make my point: Christians throughout history have sincerely believed that conversion saves the soul. Historically, and continuing through today, it\'s damned dangerous for Christians to sincerely believe they\'re doing God\'s will...which is why they feel no shame at all in telling young children that they\'ll burn for eternity if they don\'t go to church. Children being as impressionable and frankly stupid as they are, it\'s successful. \n\nBut if Christians think I\'m wrong on this...I\'d challenge the religion as a whole to cease indoctrinating children in their religion. Wait until they\'re old enough to fully understand what they\'re getting into and I guarantee a merciful, loving God won\'t toss them in hell if they die before they\'re instructed. If the religion survives in any numbers beyond a generation or two when they stop brainwashing children...then that\'s God\'s will.')

I believe that\'s against the rules.

Gender and sex are different concepts after all. Even if you wanted to argue that trans women should not be competing in women\'s sports, it\'d be due to physical advantages that their sexual development afforded them, not through a denial of their gender. \n\n> express concern over high suicide rates among an identifiable group of individuals and the lack of improvement in this regard after current medical treatments\n\nI think you could still do this and just claim ignorance and it\'d be fine. Because after-all, it\'s demonstrably wrong. All the academic and medical literature on the effects of  transition finds significant improvements of mental health and reduction in suicidality in post-transition individuals compared to pre-transition. So if you were claiming otherwise, you\'d simply just need to acknowledge you were misinformed and ignorant.\n\n> use statistics about crime rates to better understand statistics regarding police confrontations\n\nNo that\'s when they make sense. Because if certain races are found to be charged significantly more often for crime, the only possible explanation is unequal societal treatment. The other other possible explanation would be implying that race is inherently more prone to crime, which would obviously be racist. \n\n> express concern over controversial "sexual education" involving trusted adults without our knowledge\n\nThis one just isn\'t even mentioned in any capacity.\n\n> Literally 1984\n\nKind of.

We don\'t need to humor the "idea" of "should we bring back race based slavery" with a discussion. There is no advocation for that concept that isn\'t based in racism. How do you logically talk someone out of a position that\'s based in unreasonable hatred? \n\n> Misinformation is most definitely spread when people have freedom of speech, but others should be able to use their rights to speech to correct misinformation, and spectators can consider both sides of the argument to gain a better perspective and discern that truth.\n\nThis is demonstrably not what happens. The first story is what sticks, not the correction. The loudest person wins, not the correct one. The person making attacks comes off feeling like they\'re "winning" not the person calmly but defensively dismantling those attacks.\n\nHumans are [redacted]. Unfortunately logical argument rarely changes minds, emotional argument are far more effective. [This phenomenon is well studied](https://qz.com/521628/keep-losing-arguments-a-psychologist-explains-why-emotions-are-more-persuasive-than-logic/).\n\nNo comment on the woodchipper thing. I\'m not losing sleep over people advocating for murdering pedophiles, but your bullet point was about "criticizing" them, not killing them, which made me think it wasn\'t about the "woodchipper" comments, but instead about calling LGBT people groomers. \n\n> These words have traditionally been used to describe the sex of individuals, but they are beginning to be reappropriated to refer to a social concept that is now being called "gender."\n\nI\'d argue they never objectively referred to sex, only the perception of sex which is how gender has been determined for basically all of human civilization. It is semantics, but regardless of if you want to call that social concept "gender" or not, it still exists. Declining the word presented to represent it doesn\'t stop the concept from existing. \n\n> I believe that when people in power wish to restrict the ideas of a people, they target the ability for them to communicate such ideas. Currently we see a push to get rid of the language regarding biological sex and reappropriate it towards gender. \n\nThis always confuses me because it\'s the exact opposite of what\'s happening. We\'re using two different words to differentiate between the slight differences of concepts that we previously conflated. It\'s literally giving us more words to better specify the concepts we\'re talking about. Newspeak combined complex meanings into singular words. There was no "great"/"amazing"/"fantastic"/"wonderful"/"stupendous". There was good, double good, and triple good. **That** is newspeak. Identifying slight differences in concepts and using new words (like gender instead of sex) to specify those differences is the opposite. \n\n> But the fact that people are demanding that everything that used to be based on sex (sexual preferences, bathroom usage, sports teams)\n\nPeople are demanding that we recognize these things have never been based on "sex" as "sex" as a category is not some singular binary trait. \n\n- Sexual preferences are based entirely on perceivable traits. You aren\'t turned on by someone\'s chromosomes or even their internal reproductive organs. This is secondary sex traits and genitalia. \n\n- bathroom usage was even less strict. Simply secondary sex traits being the main basis. Intersex women still used the women\'s room. Their other sex traits played no part in inhibiting them. \n\n- athletics is obviously based in athletic advantage that\'s different between male and female typical sexual development. Yet intersex women compete and are found to typically have advantages over the average woman. In fact all 3 medalists of the 2016 Olympic\'s women\'s 800m race were intersex. These advantages far outweigh those of a trans woman who never went through male puberty. So this issue is a more complex one about sex hormone profiles and the development people experienced with these profiles. Not sex as a whole. \n\nTo be clear, this isn\'t an advocation for allow trans women to compete in women\'s sports. It\'s a statement that their exclusion is not necessarily on the basis of their sex, but a specific part of their sexual development, without which there\'d be no problem. \n\n> There\'s no reason why those things must be associated with gender. \n\nI don\'t actually disagree for the first and latter points, but bathroom usage is absolutely necessary in our society to align with gender. There is no reason for any sex trait to dictate bathroom usage. It would only lead to unnecessary harm. [A trans man was actually assaulted and arrested just the other day](https://www.fox19.com/2022/07/08/transgender-butler-county-man-says-group-beat-him-up-using-wrong-restroom/) for trying to use the women\'s room the bathroom that matched his "sex" instead of his gender, which the owner of the property told him to do. \n\n> I\'ve heard this idea of suicide rates not declining post-surgery so many times, and up until you replied to my comment, I\'ve never even heard an attempted rebuttal.\n\nYeah and that\'s just crazy to me because I see that misinformation being countered pretty much every time I see it, so you might be consuming some echo chamber arguments. But more importantly did you never actually look this up yourself before forming a view on it? This just further highlights the "misinformation is easy to spread and harder to correct" point. \n\n>  I strongly value truth, and so I would like to know what is right in terms of this argument.\n\nGreat, I\'ll post several but before that the more important thing to highlight is that no study has ever made the claim that transitional healthcare is ineffective in reducing suicidality. This simply does not exist, it\'s a fabricated talking point. \n\nRegardless, here\'s several:\n\nhttps://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2\n\nhttps://sci-hub.se/10.1007/bf01542484\n\nhttps://imgur.com/XBUl5BG\n\n(full study) https://sci-hub.se/10.1176/appi.ajp.2019.19010080\n\nhttps://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/\n\nhttps://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1365-2265.2009.03625.x\n\nhttps://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/134/4/696/32932/Young-Adult-Psychological-Outcome-After-Puberty?redirectedFrom=fulltext\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423\n\n> The first academic study I come across on Google is one that supports the claim to which I referred ( Dhejne C, Lichtenstein P, Boman M, Johansson ALV, L�ngstr�m N, Land�n M (2011) Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden. PLoS ONE 6(2): e16885.). I\'ll admit that I haven\'t done any type of deep research on the subject, but the ability to share this type of information is exactly why I loathe censorship so much.\n\nYeah this is the most common pointed to study by propagandists. Certainly not to say you\'re one, it\'s just the one that\'s most easily misrepresented. It\'s not comparing pre and post transition trans people, it\'s comparing post-transition trans people with the general population. Concluding that their suicidality is significantly higher than people who are not transgender. While that\'s certainly an issue of it\'s own, it\'s not a comparison with pre-transition rates, which are found to be significantly higher still. \n\nFurthermore, that elevated rate in comparison to the general population actually disappears for the subject group that received treatment past 1988. It\'s only the 1973-1988 patients that had elevated rates. 1989-2003 showed no significant difference to the general population. [The author of the study even gave an interview to clear this up](https://www.transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm) because it\'s so widely misrepresented (often intentionally). So in her own words:\n\n>Dr. Dhejne: "The study as a whole covers the period between 1973 and 2003. **If one divides the cohort into two groups, 1973 to 1988 and 1989 to 2003, one observes that for the latter group (1989 � 2003), differences in mortality, suicide attempts, and crime disappear.**\n\n>Of course trans medical and psychological care is efficacious. A 2010 meta-analysis confirmed by studies thereafter show that **medical gender confirming interventions reduces gender dysphoria.**"\n\n>"The aim of trans medical interventions is to bring a trans person�s body more in line with their gender identity, resulting in the **measurable diminishment of their gender dysphoria. However trans people as a group also experience significant social oppression in the form of bullying, abuse, rape and hate crimes**. Medical transition alone won�t resolve the effects of crushing social oppression: social anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress.\n\n>What we�ve found is that treatment models which ignore the effect of cultural oppression and outright hate aren�t enough. **We need to understand that our treatment models must be responsive to not only gender dysphoria, but the effects of anti-trans hate as well.

('Authoritarian Left', '>  but the ability to share this type of information is exactly why I loathe censorship so much.\n\nI\'ve linked to it several times but in case you aren\'t aware, sci-hub is great for that. If you can just get the DOI of a study, go to https://sci-hub.se/ and search for it and most of the time it\'ll have the full text, not just an abstract or something hidden behind a paywall. \n\n> but I believe it could be readily proven that different racial groups have different cultural values\n\nYes but this is just abstracting the problem 1 layer further. "What caused those cultural differences" is the question then being begged. It just kicks the real answer down the road, which is "was it different societal treatment or innate racial predisposition to crime/violence that resulted in a culture that is more prone to crime". One of those things is the actual answer and the other is racism. But you seem pretty understanding on this point so I won\'t dwell here. \n\n> I personally believe that strong parental figures are extremely important for child development, and I wouldn\'t be surprised if it showed up that the aforementioned statistics were even more blatant when considering unique family structures. \n\nWell yeah dude. And when a significant portion of those broken families are due to police arresting black men so they can\'t act as father figures, there\'s a clear racist societal element there. Black people have provably been discriminated in every way that results in higher likelihood of being convicted of crime. In education, in employment, in housing, in loans, in profiling, in jury selection, and in sentencing. \n\n> Again, this is why I like free speech. We need to be able to talk about this stuff. \n\nThe larger point is we have talked about this. We\'ve talked about these exact issues for centuries. The issue is people not listening and people spreading misinformation. If you take any course on on these topics they will be introductory level teaching. And even this comment I\'m writing is effectively pointless for the overall society. Even if this reaches you, either no one else will read it or this subredit will actively downvote it lol. I\'ve done this for a decade.\n\n> The only memes I\'ve seen so far on PCM that talk about "Groomers" are those referring to sex-ed in schools regarding LGBTQ+ ideology.\n\nOkay but the post said no calling LGBT people groomers. No mention of sex-ed so I had no idea where that was coming from. But even with that interpretation, you would have needed to change "no calling people who advocate for that sex-ed groomers" into "no expressing concern over that sex-ed". That seems pretty disingenuous.\n\n> Not sure what you\'re trying to say here. That having a centrist flair is assimilating into newspeak somehow?\n\nOh this was just a joke of like auth-rights flairing as centrist to present their ideology as like "reasonable middle-ground".

You argued that without mental illnes you dont need to be protected from hate speech, but it is the identity not the mental illnes that the hate targets, so I find this argument pretty pointless. And your comment about people doing it for fun is in some ways correct, it improves their happyness and life quality but so wrong in different ways. It is not a lifestyle desicion it is an identity, kind like being gay I guess but different.

There are definitely candidates that do win with true grassroots support in the US, but they're so few and far between relative to candidates who win with significant backing from the wealthy that it's very hard to say that the system is fair. \n2. So this sort of becomes a question of preference in governance, then. If you believe the president is the representative of the people, you should be against the electoral college. If you believe the president is the representative of the states, you should also be against it because it gives more votes to larger states. The US system does decide the president through a series of majority votes, but that's not a defense of why it's done like that. Clearly, the person above believes the president should be a representative of the people, rather than the states. I think picking a weird compromise position, especially with how powerful the American federal system is, is outdated, and the president *should* just be a representative of the people. But I can see the argument that the original comment is making a bad point.\n3. A party that doesn't have any chance of winning isn't a true opposition. Just because a party can split the vote doesn't mean that they make a system multi-party, because splitting a vote just means you're effectively throwing your vote out. A third party has to have an opportunity to win and impact government to count. No third party has won in the US in a long time, so currently there are no viable third parties, so the US should be considered a two party system. \n4. Personal issue, not going to argue this one\n5. His opinion I guess\n6. 33 states requiring it still leaves 17 (18? idk how we're counting DC since it does get EC votes) states that don't. That's definitely enough that it could shift election results. Of course, this has never been a problem, but it's weird to leave in. Still, I hope that this point becomes outdated, because both parties seem to be in favour of changing those 33 states to all of them.")
('Libertarian Left', "I will concede 1 and 2, you conceded 6, and 4 and 5 were pretty much conceded from the start. Generally I'm not defending OP anymore. The only one of these that I want to argue in favour of OP is 3. The US is a two party system. I want to compare the US to another country, China. China technically has 9 political parties. Sometimes those parties even win seats. But no party other than the CCP has any real influence over what actually happens in the government. For this reason, China is rightfully called a 1 party state. Similarly, in the US, while there are officially many parties, only 2 parties actually influence what happens in government, so the US is a 2 party system.\n\nThe party system status of a country is not defined by the number of official political parties, but rather by whether or not they actually matter.

Suck it up buttercup.

You�re talking about  having your feelings hurt because a white dude got made fun of in a movie.  Like, not even IRL, in *movies*. Can you see why one of those things might be worse than the other?\n\nI�m not saying that white folks don�t have it hard too, everyone who isn�t part of the property-owning class will have their own battles to fight under capitalism.

And also a society that rewards child rearing (tax credits etc) and places value on such things. Doing a ban downstream is just going to make the people have casual sex get pregnant and raise kids with single parents.

('Libertarian Left', 'TL;DR my viewpoint should offend everyone to some degree, so if you don\'t want to read just downvote me.\n\nThe debate will go nowhere.  The "left/liberal" narrative will continue to insist it\'s about controlling women\'s bodies, which is 95% horseshit.\n\nAs for "the right", I\'ve seen it argued two ways: that people should suffer 100% of the consequences of their actions, and that fetuses are fully human and therefore abortion is murder.  The first is hypocritical and would take a doctorate thesis no one will read to go through, so I won\'t bother.\n\nThe second is based and worth engaging here.  Let\'s get this out of the way: fetuses are, to some degree, human.  At least as human as a comatose patient on total life support.  "Moment of birth" is a meaningless definition in our age of induced labor, scheduled c-sections, NICUs, and high preemie survival rates.  And while I don\'t prescribe to the idea that "instant of conception = fully alive human", let\'s say for argument\'s sake that it\'s accurate.  So fetus = human.  Cool?\n\nThe REAL meat of the discussion, and the shit we need to talk through, becomes: when should it be legally justifiable terminate a human life? Related: what counts as "homicide", and when does "intentional homicide" cross over into "murder" territory?\n\nIs it murder to accidentally feed someone peanuts when they have a deadly allergy?  Is it murder to knowingly sublet a house with faulty wiring that eventually causes a fatal fire?  Is it murder to shoot an attacker dead? Is it murder to gun down a burglar who isn\'t attacking me and is actively fleeing the scene?  Is it murder to kill someone in a fit of rage, with no premeditation?  Or, more pertinent, is it murder for someone to allow doctors to a vegetative patient off life support, when they\'re fiscally and legally responsible for that person?\n\nIn most cases, these don\'t meet the legal definition of murder.  In many cases, the law will not even question the innocence of the person who took the action that ended the life.  As it shouldn\'t.\n\nSO on that merry and messy note: is it murder to terminate and remove a developing fetus that came into existence against your will, either by forceful assault or by accident, early on in the pregnancy that you cannot be said to have been negligent or cruel in your decision to terminate?\n\nI say that in the predominant majority of cases NO, it isn\'t, and generally isn\'t worthy of legal attention.\n\nNow that said: do I think people should have unlimited liberty to terminate up to and including the moment of birth?  Not necessarily.  However, I don\'t believe there\'s any 100% foolproof way to define that nuance legally.  The decision itself is best left in the hands of the parent and their medical liaison.\n\nFurther: if anyone performing any action resulting in the death of another is a murderer, then lets be consistent and start giving the death penalty to every home defender, every police officer, every negligent chef, every soldier following orders...  or accept the fact that, while human death is horrible and should be avoided as much as possible, nuance exists and not every killer should have their freedom and/or life taken away.\n\nLastly: I don\'t like the "shout your abortion" thing, and I\'m not denying the existence of people who legitimately enjoy getting abortions.  But just like psychotic mass shooters shouldn\'t be the standard by which gun-owning citizens are judged, and Capitol rioters shouldn\'t be the standard by which Trump voters are judged, neither should we judge young people who aren\'t ready to be parents yet by the standards of insane trolls.')
('Authoritarian Left', "There's a difference between understanding an argument and accepting it. I know you think abortion is murder, so a higher penalty would make sense. I don't think it's murder and rather more like getting you appendix removed, so any jail time at all is unreasonable as fuck.")

('Authoritarian Left', 'We understand the pro-life argument. But pro-lifers don\'t understand the implications of their *own* arguments. If life starts at conception, then the state must treat conception in the same way as birth. Do you realize just how much paperwork and legal rights are actually afforded to you at birth?\n\nYou make an unborn a person, and then you have to give them an SSN at conception. Considering (generously) 30% of all conceptions do not naturally go to term, you now have a mortality rate pushing 75%.\n\nNow, let\'s start talking more complicated parts of the law. If a man makes you pregnant, and you are unmarried, his child who is a legally recognized person is now using your body. Child support at conception is suddenly a must. Plus potential lawsuits for any complications. All sickness, physical and psychological, loss of opportunities etc... are now squarely 50% on the offspring of the man. In fact, an unplanned pregnancy is going to suddenly be a lot dicier, because women will now suddenly be able to accuse a man of all sorts of tomfoolery around sabotaging birth control. \n\nAnd if a woman waives her parental rights before the child is born?\n\nWhat if the woman simply chooses not to eat? What is actually feeding the child? The woman? Or the woman\'s body? The woman is now holding a citizen of the nation she\'s in. This in itself would require an entire clusterfuck of laws that would likely involve massive invasions of privacy, and would be prone to all sorts of error on the governments\' side.\n\nIf a man or a woman have a predisposition to produce non-viable fetuses, and the child dies? Can someone be sued for a wrongful death? Will the state start doing manslaughter charges?\n\nWill all miscarriages result in criminal investigations?\n\nThe questions are endless. And the fact of the matter is no "pro-lifer" has any answers to any of these questions.\n\nIf you insist life starts at conception, there is no grey area there. And you can say "oh, well the state can just start life at [x] days after conception." Well, guess what, the state now has to find a way to monitor that and define it rigidly.\n\nBecause when something that clearly isn\'t a person has to be treated exactly like a person, it gets hella complicated.\n\nYou know how we have entire sections of the law that deal entirely with minors? Well, you\'ve now made an extra stage of life that will likely need more laws specific to that stage than any other, because of all the ridiculous physical differences between an unborn child you can\'t see or monitor without modern tech, and a very unambiguous real person.\n\nAlso, if life begins at conception, then (and this will piss off a lot of pro-lifers), countries with "right-of-soil" suddenly have to give a child citizenship at conception. Because, again, they are recognizing this unborn child as a person.\n\nAnd what about countries that (sanely) don\'t register their children as real people? Say you\'re a citizen of Europe and the US, what happens when you conceive a child in Europe, are pregnant, and then go to the US?\n\nDoes the US suddenly need to monitor expecting or pregnant women abroad? Because again, they have a potential citizen of their country wherever they\'re at.\n\nDo women need to be pregnancy tested at the border for simple vacations? Because think about how wild it would be if the state both recognized unborn children as real people **and** didn\'t do that.\n\nImagine a Canadian woman, who conceives in the US, suddenly they have a child who is a person in one country and not in the other? Do you detain a foreign national while you register that child through the legal process? And you\'re going to start owing a lot of countries a lot of money if you start detaining their citizens, also, they can suddenly gain much broader rights to sue you.\n\nWhat happens if a US citizen knocks up a foreign national while abroad? There\'s an entire extra minefield.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, you can\'t revoke US citizenship. And getting rid of birthright by soil simply to make a new class of unborn citizen will derail a massive portion of existing law, so you can\'t just do that.')

You wouldn�t call it murder if you killed a fish or a lizard\n\nPersonally, my view of the more typical 20 week abortion is that the fetus is way too developed to be terminated, I mean looking at pictures of a 20 week fetus it just looks like a skinnier baby. They respond to external stimuli and can sleep and dream. That�s on its way to being a person in my view.\n\nSo the line I draw is if it�s nervous system is properly developed, which is at about 8 weeks after gestation. At this time it just developed a basic central nervous system.\n\nPregnancy is often detected by a HCG test, three or four weeks after a missed period, and so this gives 4 to 5 weeks in which the woman can get an abortion. (Ofc, this would mean that pregnancy tests would need to be more accessible).\n\nAlthough I do think we should make sure contraceptives are more widely used and be more careful, a lot of women getting abortions are still hormonal teens who are likely to slip up and have accidents, and having baby being such a large undertaking, and the potential mother may not be able to emotionally or financially support a child if they are barely out of being one themselves. Therefore abortion should still be an option, with restrictions and parameters involved though, as we are dealing with something that could be human life at a point.\n\nExceptions should be made for incest, rape, or when the mother�s life is in danger, but then again unless there is the possibility that someone could say they�d been raped in order to get a later termination.')

But that\'s kind of ridiculous - in abortion and in discarding of embryos, you literally kill the unborn, while in the case they fail to implant/miscarry - well, there\'s nothing you can do about that. Using that as a means of justifying abortion is like saying that high mortality rate among newborn children justifies killing them outright.\n\nIn any case, I\'d need to look more into the subject to give you a more complex answer!\n\nAbout the last part, though: I\'ll just copy and paste my other comment, if that\'s alright?\n\n"What if you were in a burning building and could only save either a newborn or an old lady? Would choosing one of them make the other person less valuable then? Or less of a person? Like, if I were to choose the kid, would that make the lady less of a human being? Absolutely not, and vice-versa. Therefore I don\'t think that\'s a good argument?Though you could say that zygotes don\'t really feel pain. At the same time, though, there are born people who also don\'t feel pain. You could say that the woman can reason, has a personality ect., but do newborns have that? It seems like they don\'t, since babies only start getting consciousness around 5 months after birth."\n\n\\^ This is why I don\'t like this hypothetical.

Like, imagine in one room is a cure for cancer that could save countless lives, and you know that it could never be replicated. In another, there are 20 comatose people who may wake up in a couple of months but don\'t feel pain at the moment. In another room is a crying baby. Which one/ones would you save?

Really it comes down to a lot of different things but one of the main things is idk what studies you have showing that. To me it sounds more like a contributing factor, like even for another example feeding your child badly, it makes them more likely to be obese and die or something. But idk if we could make that illegal, like how would the law work, and that can be offset by exercise. Just a murky issue where I don�t think the law needs to be involved and your culpability is lessened depending on the circumstances. But if you could show that a certain amount of caffeine induces a state where your uterine wall loses its ability to receive eggs then maybe we can talk about it. However at that point it may be appropriate to talk about likelihood then even, and embryos already have no great natural odds (relative to say a normal child going about their day) so I mean how much does that effect it? And again how will we police it? It just seems a prudential matter and it seems to me my prudence says there is no need for a law. If the uterine wall doesn�t accept the embryo then how do we even judge if that was because of the caffeine or basically just bad luck?

One is actively taking a life based on the assumption there will be suffering, the other is allowing it to end naturally.\n\nLeave a terminally ill child to finish their natural process with no intervention, and they\'ll die.\n\nLeave an otherwise healthy fetus to finish it\'s natural process with no intervention, and it will become a fully functioning human being.')

They have a lot more legal teeth now (which is a good thing) so I generally don't pay as much attention to it. There are far more pressing issues in their communities, namely drug addiction.\n\nI looked at that Venezuelan coup attempt and it seems that it wasn't US backed so much as backed by mercenaries from the US. Now as a matter of fairness you could claim that that was just a cover story, but by the same token even the United States government isn't incompetent to the point they thought a fishing boat invasion would do anything.\n\nI think Venezuela could certainly use a coup though. Those people are suffering greatly.\n\n>Wealth disparity\n\nHere is something we could agree on for sure I just think we would probably disagree on the solutions to it. I'm personally of the mind that a more free approach in the form of UBI would be best, the more left minded people may prefer a more socialist approach. I take issue with the idea that billionaires haven't earned their money though. I think that Microsoft as a company is certainly worth its market capitalization and Bill Gates is well deserving of the wealth he obtained from it. I think that Amazon as a company is certainly worth its market capitalization and Jeff bezos is well deserving of the wealth he's obtained from it. however at a certain point the lock-up of all that value is detrimental to the health of the economy and the economic prosperity of the nation's citizens. I don't think policies that just directly tax people without providing an incentive for those that are wealthy to take alternative means that would be more beneficial for the society and are associated with tax breaks are healthy.\n\nFor example Jeff Bezos has that pet space company called Blue Oriigin. If we were to Levy new taxes on the super rich but associate large tax breaks with investment into industries the United States deems particularly valuable (like space) then we can have the best of both worlds.\n\n>Gerrymandering\n\nDistrict drawing should be done by algorithms\n\n>Treatment of minorities\n\nCops should wear body cams and there needs to either be less collusion between the prosecutor's office and police or an oversight department to make sure that they're not playing favorites\n\n>Influence of corporations\n\nLobbying is a gray area and I don't really want to get into it here but I want to make it clear that it's not all bad. It effectively serves as a way for the government to be made aware of corporate interests, like if a bill could have potential unforseen negative effects that the government isn't otherwise aware of.")

I think the solution to that would be that people who work only temporarily overseas but retain a permenant home and permenant citizenship in the original country get a vote, but anyone who resides permenantly and/or does not reside for work reasons in another country don't get a vote. \n\nFor example in the UK you get fuckloads of retirees who go off and live in Spain til they die, they shouldn't get a vote in the UK because whatever happens in the UK doesn't affect them, but they should get a vote in Spain because it affects them because that's where they live. Of course that doesn't make sense if they don't pay taxes in Spain because that's taxation without representation in the UK and representation without taxation in Spain for them, but I assume (though I don't know) Spain has some kind of retail tax that they're subject to, and maybe some kind of solution could be worked out with transferring their pension to be in Spain, or maybe they just pay the taxes on their pension to the Spanish govt at the rate they would in the UK, or whatever whatever. \n\nThe point is if someone stays in another country for good then the elections in their home country essentially no longer affect them and they shouldn't get a vote.")

They assume well just vote for whatever toady they tout out on that stage because at least they�re closer to left than the other guy. Here�s an example of the constant way they split in our face: you just had a rather ugly nomination, you should in some regard make some concession to the large part of your base that just lost right? Picking Sanders as VP would be super popular and would secure those votes, picking Tulsi would at least show that you hear those voices in your party and would still get you your precious woman VP that you�re so concerned about. Instead they�re rumored to pick Kamala Harris, who is despised by most of us. Not even the slightest attempt to appeal to our agenda.\n\nWell we make up a good 30% or more of the party, and we�re coming to realize that this will always be how they operate as long as they assume they�ll get out vote no matter what. If anything, were finally *starting* to form a coalition, a coalition that says �you don�t own our vote, and you won�t until you start making concessions to what we want done.� To people like me, it�s not the end of the world if Trump gets re-elected, and I could care less honestly.')

If you want to sort of tell a story with them, you need as much data as you can get.\n\nAn example I still love is when I was new to reddit and went to r/atheism before realizing it was shit, one thing they pushed was 90% of prison inmates are christian. But Christians only made up about 75-80% of the population. So obviously more christians were criminals than other groups.\n\nUnfortunately that really doesn't actually tell me much. For instance, how many converted after being put in there? It wouldn't surprise me that some people, while working through their guilt, used religion as a way to find personal forgiveness. There's also the question of how many are really Christian. I hate to use a No True Scotsman arguement, but if you point to a person who pushed drugs and was arrested for stabbing someone while robbing them, and told me they were a Christian before getting arrested, I would question how much that should count. Maybe an extreme example, but it still makes the numbers seem a bit off IMO.\n\nSo them we go back to the whole black people issue. We know for a fact that black people have been systematically held down. And a lot of the things that fucked with them wasn't done all that long ago. There are people alive today who went through segregation. And even after that ended, we know the governmebt did things like put drugs in black communities to make life harder for them. It's also been shown they get arrested for the same crimes more often than white people. They get harsher sentences, similar to how men get harsher sentences than women.\n\nIs there a problem with crime in the black community? Yes. Is it because they're black? No. Anyone who thinks it's because of pigment is dumb as shit. If they say it's because of culture, then we need to explore why they have a culture that has a crime problem. Not turn it back around to the color of their skin.\n\nPeople who bitch about other saying that stats are racist are just looking for an excuse to continue to justify their racism. No one is saying facts are racist, just that people use them for their racism.\n\nEdit: Also, trying to find out how to flair up on mobile. Or at least on this app")

This particular AHS moderator has been sent CP, accused of posting CP in other subs, doxxed, and harassed in real life.  The ~~mods~~ admins have investigated, and view it as a sustained harassment campaign.\n\nThis confuses people who come in and wonder what is going on. The admins aren\'t tolerating it anymore.  They are not willing to spend time sifting through the honestly curious people and the guys that "are just asking questions" (i.e. Why\'s it a big deal if there\'s nothing to hide?).\n\nSince, in the past, trolls were posting CP and saying it was this mod, the admins feel there is a similar pattern with the conspiracy of "AHS is posting CP to get Right-Wing subs banned".

A Maoist and Panther who later became a leading member of the Black Liberation Army and engaged in armed resistance against the united states as well as extrajudicial killings of drug dealers. Was at the top of the most wanted list for a while. She was eventually caught, but escaped and found political asylum in Cuba where she still lives today. She's also Tupac's aunt.\n* Sophie Scholl for libleft. She was a German socialist who tried to organize a pacifist resistance against Hitler, with ties to a lot of other resistance members. The Nazis caught her and sentenced her to death by guillotine, and she became a martyr to resistance groups all over Europe. Her writings on pacifism were later airdropped everywhere in Germany by the allies. There's a decent movie about her, *the Final Days*.\n* Simone de Beauvoir for libleft. Arguably the founder of second-wave feminism, the person to spark an interest in looking at the social rather than the legal relations between men and women. Also an influential libertarian socialist and anti-Soviet Marxist, as well as a founding existentialist philosopher.\n* Ursula Le Guin for libleft. Famous author of fiction with anarchist themes, also famous author of anarchist non-fiction. One of the greatest American writers ever, cited as a literary influence by many modern writers. She also singlehandedly collected and digitized a *lot* of old anarchist writings, and the modern revival of the anarchist tradition after the decline of anarchism between Catalonia and the 60s is partially due to her.")

('Libertarian Right', 'Speaking purely philosophically, nothing that requires the positive actions of another can be termed a "right". Otherwise you get into absurd contradictions like, say, the Italian government having to choose who lives and who dies in the coronavirus outbreak. Are they invalidating people\'s rights by having to make those choices? There is no conceivable world where they could *not* be violating people\'s rights, then--at least not with the parameters given. There\'s not even the possibility of doing nothing and remaining morally irreproachable. Every action leads to violation. And if the simple physical limitations of reality can take away a right, how is that a right at all? \n\nWhat universal healthcare is, is a *privilege*. It\'s one we take for granted in the modern world, but one that is dearly paid for by the blood, sweat, and tears of our fathers. You could easily explain to a medieval peasant the right to bear arms or the right to free speech or the right to property. In many cases, some of the better off peasants and city-dwellers *had* such rights. But to unlimited healthcare at any point in time no matter the illness or circumstances? The very idea is absurd. The systems in place then just wouldn\'t be able to support it. Again, if all you have to do to invalidate a right is to travel back in time, how is that a right at all?\n\nFundamentally, I think it\'s a confusion and conflation between the concept of rights and the philosophical notion--which I agree with--that it is fundamentally okay to do whatever is necessary to preserve life. Almost everyone agrees it\'s all right to steal, say, medicine from some theoretical miser who\'s hoarding it to save a person\'s life. Even taking another\'s life is, while seen as regrettable, not exactly something wrong enough to punish. When a German soldier in WW1 later told the story of how he, during a gas attack, found that his gas mask was damaged and so took the mask off of a wounded soldier to save himself--leaving that boy to die painfully and miserably--no one even considered the idea of punishing him for it. Even if you like to think you\'d do otherwise in his shoes. \n\ntl;dr: health care isn\'t a human right, but we all instinctively know that it\'s just to abrogate rights for the sake of preservation of life. But because this is an unexpressed gut feeling, it often is uttered by the rational mind as "Health care is a human right" even though this is philosophically absurd.')

('Libertarian Right', "Right, but one big medical bill wipes out that surplus for thousands of subscribers. I'm in a financial industry that gives me reason to be looking at financial statements for a wide variety of companies, including health insurers and hospitals, and the hospitals grossly overinflate prices so that they're in the black from insurance payouts alone, since they're easier to collect from than individuals. To the degree that hospitals barely even try to get your portion of the bill from you before they just sell the debt off for pennies on the dollar to a collection company - it's quite literally not worth their time to chase down the $200 you owe them when they've already collected $2k from your insurance company. Something like 40% of people have medical collections on their credit report for bills they don't even know about (40% is probably wrong now, that was the number a few years ago before some regulations changed what appears on a report so may be different now).\n\nAnd hospitals aren't talking about struggling with treating uninsured patients in their management letters, but insurers (especially small ones) are definitely talking about increasing costs from hospitals and how to mitigate that. \n\nJust sharing what I see with a look behind the curtain that most people don't get. Definitely not a one-dimensional problem, but it's naive when people act like the hospitals are the good guys here.")
('Libertarian Right', "I said more to another reply, but insurers definitely don't want to see healthcare costs continue to rise. The problem is multifaceted - hospitals overcharge out of the gate expecting insurance companies to offset the cost for the uninsured and to pad their bottom line. Most health insurance is a layer or two removed from the end patient, so the companies can charge a little more than they might otherwise be able to. And since insurance companies keep the lights on at a hospital, most don't really care if the patient pays their portion of the bill or not, so they don't even bother putting resources towards trying to collect the remainder of a bill from patients most of the time. IMO the system needs to be brought under control via some regulation and regulatory changes before we address who pays the final bill if we want it to be sustainable. \n\nAs we're all seeing during this pandemic crisis though, being a doctor or nurse is fucking hard. In the best of times, you're talking about a 12+ hour shift where one brief mental lapse could literally kill someone. Not a lot of people can do that job, and those that can definitely deserve to be paid extremely well.")

In this case, most auths would agree that a single terrorists� well-being and dignity is a welcome price for the sake of many. \n\n\nIn my personal authleft utopia -full communism aside- human rights would be granted at birth, but revoking them would be an option. What crimes (and contexts of crimes) deserve denying the criminal�s human rights would be codified by an entity that is separate from the state as a safeguard. This entity would aim to protect society over the criminal, but also acknowledge the importance of what human rights entail and represent. The denial of human rights would also be preventive of further related crimes rather than punitive. This entity could also decide on a case-by-case basis if needed. The state would be merely an actor that enforces the laws with no say in when denial of human rights is applied.\n\nSome examples:  \n\nTerrorism - torture ok, no right to trial if it�s reasonably deemed useless (e.g. caught making bombs or armed after committing an attack), no right to life (can be stood up against a wall if no longer useful in the investigation)  \n\nHard drug smuggler - torture ok, otherwise all human rights granted  \n\nSoft drug smuggler - all human rights granted. \n\nDrug dealer or user, hard or soft- all human rights granted. \n\nOrganized crime, violent - torture ok, no right to trial, no right to life  \n\nOrganized crime, non-violent - all human rights granted  \n\nRapist - all human rights granted. \n\nRape ring - torture ok  \n\nIn the end, the denial of human rights wouldn�t be a kneejerk reaction, but an authorization of tools and methods when the situation necessitates their use in protecting greater society. Fear of another attack? Take their nails. Kidnapping ring? Nails. Illegal weapons transaction? Might as well shoot on sight and interrogate the survivors.

It leads to addiction and illegal distribution. The illegalization of drug addiction doesn�t help the addict. It needs to be treated as a medical issue, and the drugs need to be distributed in a regulated way by the government as a way of ensuring a user�s safety. If they�re allowed to do something, they�re less likely to want to do it. �We want what we can�t have� and all that.\n\nI don�t see how this damages the family structure.

Also it seems like I just began to write a wall of text to explain the libleft position on those 3 words so I guess the meme was accurate with all its imperfection because the meme ask a definition of the political value with only one  word that could mean basicaly anything depending of the interpretation we make. The fact is that the libleft inpretation of those words is more true and more useful that the one each other quadrant use. the concept of liberty for exemple in the libright interpretation, would be more accurately described as the dictatorship of the capital because the liberty they defend is based on the value of the property each person possesses, as such the interest of those who own nothing would not be respected and only those who can use their capital will rightfully influence the way society work in this paradigm, thus the level of liberty each person enjoy would vary according to their relative wealth so tbe less wealthy would not have the same liberty that the rich would enjoy. liberty without equality is the tyrany of the powerful. Secondly the order autright defend is, in fact, chaos. The autright claim that their subjective perspective of what normality should be the eternal order and they never acknoledge that their idea doesnt correspond to reality and thus the "order" they create always have to fight against the reality that the world doesnt comply with the delusion they live in,  because of the idea that they protect   their order against the true order in which every progressive movement strive toward, they create and entertain the dialectical struggle between reality and the illusion of a pure tradition, creating chaos, a struggle between the old and the new and a war between reality and the narative that keep them in power. A true order would be to accept and evolve with the world and its diversity rather than to fight for the violent dominion of one\'s subjective archetype over the other. In fact, Anarchy is order! damn I\'m tired please for the rest imagined that I continue my rant by explaining how equality need freedom to be useful and that equality alone without taking needs into account contradictory and that only free and equal access to the means and the fruits of production is can bring a more healthy type of equality. to conclude not only is liberty, order and equality not contradictory they have to evolve in unity with one another to realy bring the best of each concept and the libleft position is the only that acknowledge and impleament them as such. The Autright oppose Progress with Order and only create Chaos. The Libright oppose Equality with Liberty and Autleft oppose Liberty with Equality and both can only create Tyrany. Only with libleft   can Liberty and Equality, Anarchy and communism, colaborate and thrive, and bring true Order by evolving with the world instead of opposing it.')

They might tan as they worked in the sun but that's an environmental trait, not a genetic one \n\n2. If what you claim were true, it doesn't explain why African nobility was just as black as African peasantry. Wouldn't the nobles who stayed inside all day have evolved white skin? Or is there some other factor that causes skin color that isn't related to class at all? \n\n3. While we don't completely understand why people are different colors, we're fairly certain that it's because of geographic distribution and evolution around 40,000 years ago, and it has little to do with modern (and by modern I mean the last couple thousand years) concepts of class.")

The term "Lebanese" has become a term of gentrification when certain cultural items are called "Lebanese X" in order to further stamp out other MENA cultures from establishing roots in their diaspora nations. \n\nIt irks me when I walk into a trendy MENA restaurant and see a cherished food item like sambousek and watching it being labeled as "Lebanese Cheese Tacquitos." \n\nI can understand the notion of not wanting to be Arab, considering that the adoption of the Arab identity is rather recent and heavily rooted in Islamic conquest.\n\nAnd it doesn\'t help that local Lebanese in Lebanon are also just as racist against other ethnic groups within the nation such as Syrians and Armenians.

('Authoritarian Left', '1. Those in the lower class labor, those in the upper class administrate. The lower class people have darker skin from working in the sun. People begin to associate lighter skin with wealth. Because of this, lighter skin is viewed as more attractive. Because of this, upper class people tended to marry lighter skinned people. The higher on the pyramid a person is, the more choosy they can be for who they marry. Over time, the upper class isn�t just lighter because they don�t work in the sun, they are genetically lighter skinned. \n\n2. Two possible explanations. Explanation one: The work of the upper classes in these societies put them in the sun a lot. Maybe their cultures focused on martial prowess, traveling, or watching over herds and flocks. Explanation 2: Perhaps the process described in one only occurs for people whose skin color changes a lot depending on the amount of sun they have. Some people with very light skin may barely get darker even after frying in the sun. The same might be true for people with very dark skin. \n\n3. Yes, I agree that we cannot apply modern class concepts to people 40,000 years ago.

There is no certainty here that the securities will be later available for the seller to actually deliver to the buyer at the time of delivery. Naked short selling has been considered a way of manipulating the price of securities. As the short sellers can increase supply very fast, there is a rapid drop in the price of the security. Nervous investors then start closing their long positions which continues to increase supply and there is little if any demand. The short sellers are then able to easily buy back what they short sold at a much lower price.\n\nIt�s selling a stock short without ever holding to stock for even half a second. It�s 100% market manipulation and now the higher ups are getting mad that WSB 100% called them on their game, found that if you find a group of people that instead of getting scared and selling, just buy more stock, that makes short selling is literally the dumbest most dangerous shit in the fucking world.')

The drum we should be banging as libertarians is that it\'s individual freedom that is the goal, not anarchy, and sometimes these two goals are in conflict with each other. Sometimes collectivist actions are necessary; civil society can and should force such measures to be temporary and proportional to the risk. Lockdowns during a pandemic satisfy both criteria.\n\nThe "incentive structure" argument only works if the true cost of a risky deed is borne by the person who performs the deed. I\'m also for a carbon tax for that reason. You want to pollute my air, you\'d better pay for it. If there were a method of fairly determining the likely monetary damage by a person going out in public, and if there were a system of collecting this "covid tax", then I\'d be in favor of ending the lockdowns too.')

If they pay to be schmucks, and they are willing to suffer the social judgment, more power to them. I support a Georgist land rent, for example, as well as carbon taxes; so long as fair prices are paid, rich people are welcome to behave however they want. I think that's not a bug, that's a feature.\n\n> Also, define cost - if someone goes out when they should be quarantining, and don't really care about getting fined or taxed for it because they have the money to pay it, are they really the ones bearing the true cost of risky behavior?\n\nWell, by definition, the tax is supposed to cover that risk. The tax proceeds can go to all costs related to COVID treatment, as well as paying the deceased an amount that is, say, equal to some reasonable estimate of the actuarial value of their life. In practice, these costs are so high that it would be prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the population to pay the tax. I don't care about the 1% that can still afford it -- as far as I'm concerned, if some people are willing to pay that tax then that would actually a good outcome, because it's a transfer of wealth from irresponsible people to those who need medical treatment. It's similar to how rich trust fund kids have the effect of subsidizing high-quality education for their poor classmates.")

Maybe an example:\n\nIn most developed nations, it's generally illegal to dump toxic chemical waste in local drinking water supplies. Now imagine there's a pharmaceutical company with a factory that is dumping their waste into the local water supply. To simplify, let's make it a small company with just one director and two hundred workers. The water supply supplies drinking water to the local town with a population of 2000. When questioned, the director says that he has the best intentions with this because he's not only creating 200 jobs, but he's literally making life saving medication, and he'll go bankrupt if he doesn't do as he's been doing. \n\nSo my question is when (if ever) should another power intervene and force the factory shut?\n\nThe example is a hypothetical and probably unrealistic scenario, but I'm interested in your political standing on the situation.")

But >96% of the people are heterosexual - why should it be considered offensive for that to be assumed as a norm and why should it be considered some kind of sinister oppressive ideology?\n\nAnother thing is the crusade against "Eurocentrism" in culture and similar issues in countries which are historically majority European with a forced attempt to overrepresent minorities or to portray the majority culture as inherently oppressive, violent, simply wrong.')

That's a whole bunch of problems that infringes upon the domestic population to an unacceptable degree and has to be cracked down upon by state power.\n\nSome authright users are ethno-nationalists though, and their solutions will differ a bit, won't be as supported and lacks pragmatism.")

Stalin was aware even a position like a secretary, if used correctly, could decide the fate of a nation, mostly becausr thats what he did himself to get to power.\n\nAlso the purges happened years before Germany attacked and werent close to the reason the USSR suffered such losses.\n\nThe main reason for the huge losses of the USSR were mainly how Germany saw this as a war of extermination so plans were made to kill as many Soviets as possible, be it active combatant, POW or civilian.\n\nAnd the second was that the USSR was undergoing a full re-organization and it was moving its units around to make a more modern unit make-up and distribution of forces. Most of the initial engagements caught many Soviet units without a single artillery piece and were forced to use tanks in suicide charges to keep the German artillety occupied while the infantry moved in.\n\nAs to why said re-organization was happening when it did  Stalin thought that Hitler would have been a moron to open a second front while at war with Britain as that kind of attack would leave Germany with a bleak future being hammered by numerically superior forces in 2 sides.\n\nWhich was proven right, once the Soviet military organized properly.\n\nAlso, the Holodomor was mostly a result of the USSR inhereting a almost medieval farming infrastructure, which was prone to local famines due to poor communication, techniques and storing. As the Holodomor was a result of a widespread famine in many parts of the USSR, including Kazakhistan who lost around 40% of its population to famine.\n\nThose were harsh years which had seen record droughts throughout the entirety of the USSR, and now it had much higher needs for food due to the rapid industrialization, which also caused a lack of manpower to farm(since agriculture was still behind techbologically as I said before, manual labour was still the main producer). Also many Kulaks(wealthy peasantry) sabotaged their harvests in protest to land redistribution.')

Not because you involved yourself with them but because they involved themselves with you. At that point, it's literally a penalty for existing. \n\nBut none of that even addresses main point. The main point is that you're correct, taxes way way way work out in my favor. They provide all the tools and resources I need to live a comfortable life with minimum effort. But that doesn't justify them. I might be fine with it, but lots of people aren't. It is wrong of me to force other people to live by my rules. A very analogous comparison is American slavery. Pretty much everyone involved in slavery benefited from it. That's not to say it was preferable to everyone involved but that even the slaves ended up having better lives that offered education, food, shelter, and futures for their children that morphed into one of the best futures imaginable. \n\nStill, it's easy to see how wrong it is, how immoral you need to be to compel behavior of people to your own advantage. If taxation really is to everyone's benefit, the solution is to make them optional. People who are benefited will happily contribute to something that is benefiting them. And if it's not contributed to, obviously people find their own use if their money more beneficial to their end goals.

His campaign in 2016 and now started the ball rolling. Socialism was a 'scary word' for a long time. It was perceived in America as downright evil.

I guess you could call him a democratic socialist with Trotskyist sympathies, if you want.

('Libertarian Left', 'Also the view of the Soviet Union as a degenerated workers\' state, which together with the permanent revolution form pretty much the largest components of Trotskyist theory. And the POUM was formed partially from a party which had previously openly identified itself as a part of the international left opposition, and which Trotsky up until... 1936?... had supported. Hence why I said "approximately Trotskyist". But you\'re right, Trotsky himself didn\'t like them much, and the other half of POUM wasn\'t exactly Trotskyist. It\'s kind of obscure, but yeah.')

I remember that in the ending of the animated movie the original farm owners return to "liberate" the animals from their tyranny and the animals are overjoyed (thus implicitly discrediting the animals\' entire revolutionary endeavor). *This is not* how the book ended. The book never invalidates the animals\' revolution, but rather warns about the dangers of letting a revolution be hijacked by reactionary interests, which is also in line with the general message of Nineteen Eighty-Four (as well as being in line with Orwell\'s views as favourable towards socialism but opposed to Stalinism).  \n\n\nIf you\'ve ever read about the history of the Russian Revolution and how things evolved from 1900 to about 1921, Animal Farm is a detailed critique of how and where the Russian Revolution backfired in this process, and how things really started to become problematic when Lenin and the Bolshevik party consolidated power.

As someone with many Northern Irish friends from across both sides of the spectrum, it isn�t as simple as Catholic = Republican and Protestant = Unionist. Look at the advance of the Alliance political party, there�s many people from both sides who detest the sectarianism and don�t advocate for either. I�ve heard Catholic friends, with Irish passports but raised in NI, advocate for remaining in the UK due to NHS access and the large amount of public sector workers in NI. Similarly I know Prods who think the DUP are backwards bastards, with their anti gay marriage and anti-abortion views. One thing Brits and Irish people agree on, is Americans are fucking clueless on this. So many Brits feel that American people (from Boston etc) funded terrorism here in the UK, only to turn around and declare a �War on Terror� when they were attacked post 9/11.\n\nEDIT: fuck that racism at the end too. As a Londoner living in Manchester, I love the diversity here.')

('Libertarian Right', "When we talk about unacceptable hate in a political or social context, we are talking about personally held dislike of a person's color, ethenicity, sex, or orientation (things they can't control). Religion and culture are grayer areas since they are social constructs that are capable of maintaining unacceptably hateful views of their own. \n\nThe problem with holding hateful views is that they tend to lead to hateful actions. Genocides don't happen until enough people hold a certain flavor of hate or someone with that view gains power. We shouldn't and don't actively police hateful beliefs, but they have a habit of spreading like wildfire when they become entrenched or espoused by a person with power or influence. \n\nIn your example, it shouldn't matter if LBJ personally held racist views as long as he didn't use his influence to spread them or his power to institute policies that oppressed people he disliked for reasons beyond their control. In contrast, there usually isn't anything wrong with hating a social construct or organization that can be subject to change internally by the members of that group like a political party or can undergo a schism like a religion if they cannot meet the prevailing socially acceptable moral standards of the era. Even then, they should only be pushed to change through non-violent means and internal consensus.")

But when you hate someone, that respect disappears, and you'd be perfectly complacent if not happy if harm came to them.\n\nThat's why hatred is such a bad thing. You might not actively increase a person's suffering, and even try to reverse it, but from the moment your disrespect for someone goes from simply disliking something they do to disliking something which is a fundamental part of them, there's no moral barriers between you and harming them -or even just being complacent in someone else harming them. The same way a gun isn't inherently bad; you don't have to shoot anyone or anything with it, but if you go out and buy a gun it makes causing damage much easier and much more likely to happen.")

came out as gay, polyamorous, and even discovered a new sexuality, his male partner, Tyler Demetri Joonies, is an astrophysicist in the year 2054, even though Kanye has not met him, he pronounces his love to him and comes out as the first Futur-sexual.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**December 25th, 2021**\n\nThe U.S. has completely paid off their debt to china, healthcare is free not because Kanye set up an elaborate social net to catch people who can�t afford insurance, but because his Freedom Bonds earned so much money that hospitals have enough money to run at full capacity for 300 years.\n\nResearch into methods of turning the US invisible are still ongoing, but with promising results.\n\nA rich business man named [REDACTED] managed to smuggle a Freedom Bond out of the US, through his private yacht.\n\nTo his surprise, as soon as he reached international waters the bond lost its brilliant color, and he no longer felt young, in fact, he felt as though he was older than he was.\n\nHe begins plans to fund the reverse engineering of a freedom bond.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**July 4th, 2022**\n\nPresident Kanye has withdrawn all military troops, auxiliary or otherwise, stating that �The United States have become too disconnected on a global scale to continue these dangerous war games�\n\nDespite what seems to be a sudden withdrawing of troops, there are no insurrections, and the middle east has miraculously become more stable.\n\nFreedom.Inc, established to reverse engineer freedom bonds, has made significant progress, although it is unable to determine the makeup, they conclude that they are made with 100% Local Materials, hence why they don�t work outside of the US.\n\nKanye declares that the project to close off america via �an invisibility cloak� has concluded, with less than satisfactory results.\n\nWill instead be funding Clean Nuclear Energy.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**April 17th, 2023**\n\nNuclear Power Plants have popped up across the nation, adding free electricity and utilities to the benefits of being an American, alongside healthcare, simply because electricity is so cheap that it costs more to withhold it than it does to let everyone have it.\n\nFreedom Inc have discovered the secret behind the legendary Freedom Bonds, its the will of the American People.\n\nUsing an energized form of the American �Spirit� Kanye was able to create mythical bonds which restore vigor to anyone, they suspect he harvests it during his numerous rallies and tours.\n\nEveryone outside of America has been declared a 1st-ish world country, with many people, rich and poor alike, clamoring to be let in.\n\nEveryone is proud of anything slightly close to America, clothes and appliances rumored to be made in america (since america exports nothing) are regarded as rare collectibles, similar to a beatles record.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**August 29th, 2023**\n\nKanye�s first term is beginning to end, but everyone knows that a re-election would be a landslide, America is positively glowing, and even has China owing them vast sums of money.\n\nFreedom Bonds only get stronger as the american spirit is raised higher and higher by their enigmatic leader, but replications are unsuccessful.\n\nIn an effort to combat him, the Democrats and the Republicans have merged into one party, the Republicrats, even with this, they stand no chance.\n\nThe whole world envied America, but soon, things would change, Kanye had been watching Black Panther everyday since his presidency, and he knew he needed a way to block America off from the world.\n\nLuckily, there were a massive amount of nuclear power plants sitting around the country.\n\nKanye had a plan.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 21st, 2024**\n\nConsidering the circumstances, it was actually a tossup as to who would win the presidency, with the Republicrats running on a direct, yet split platform.\n\nAs though they had been frankenstiened together, their policies were a mix between far left and far right. \n\nSurprisingly, 40% loved it.\n\nHowever, Kanye had an ace up his sleeve.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 23rd, 2024**\n\nMillions of powerplants across the nation had malfunctioned, practically erupting in radiation, with the estimated death tolls to be somewhere in the real of 4 million.\n\nKanye responded like a hardened president, containing the disasters, safeproofing the unaffected plants, and launching an investigation into what caused the disaster. \n\nTo the rest of the world, the US had exploded, with reported deaths of 100 million.\n\nAmerica went from being the 1st world country to a 3rd world country overnight.\n\nSpecial clearance was needed to even fly over the once glorious states, and you can forget about landing, a select few representatives were chosen to brave the dangers of the US, each country sending them with methods to resist the radiation which had surely overtaken the land.\n\nBut, to the Americans, nothing of that scale happened. \n\nKanye had it controlled so well it was almost as though he had prepared specifically for this.\n\nTruthfully, only around 500k people died, most being prisoners or so elderly that even freedom bonds couldn�t preserve them for much longer.\n\nThe investigation finished, arresting prominent members of the Republicrats Party for orchestrating a coup.\n\nKanye had achieved his Wakanda, and he still had 4 more years to be president.\n\nThis truly is the best timeline.')

Basically nationalist Spain was made up of the monarchists, fascists, industrialists and just your average right wing authoritarians (aka the military). Franco was popular amongst the military and was able to work with all sides and all sides trusted him so they stayed United against the leftest who retardedly went into a civil war while fighting a civil war. Real smart stuff really from our lib left friends but Franco was similar to Pinochet he was just a military leader and ruled like one. He didn't really have a special ideaology or anything. Basically he was just someone who didn't like commies and would have sided with anyone who fought communists which is why he aligned himself with the USA after WW2.\n\nItaly under Mussolini is an example of a fascists state and you could argue modern china is one as well.")

('Authoritarian Right', 'A good argument for monarchy is "skin in the game". In a monarchy the longterm interest of the rulers align with the long term interests of the subjects. The better the nation is doing the more powerful the monarch becomes. Therefore he wants his nation to do well. His fate and the rest of his life is bound to the future of his nation if the nation is doing bad so is he. In a democracy this is not the case the only thing politicians have to care about is the next election so they will plot to take more power by any means even if it is bad for the country. For example the massive debt of almost every democratic nation. While making debts is bad for the country it is good for the politician because spending is extremely popular with voters because it gives them money in the short term. For a monarch this is not the case because he knows that the debts won\'t disappear and that he or his children will have to deal with them. \n\nAnother argument is arguing from the iron law of oligarchy. "Regardless of the egalitarian principles they profess, human collectives are always ruled by a small minority of leaders who set the important elements of the social and political agenda." In modern democratic society the ruling class aren\'t only the politicians they are acctualy the weakest among the rulers. In democracy the rulers are people with social power those who shape opinions, the owners of news cooperations, big businesses and actors. They determine the long term societal context in which political opinions are formed and which opinions are outside the social acceptedness. In real monarchies(were the monarch and the nobility acctualy have power so not Britain) the people with power can be identified as such and don\'t rule secretly from the shadows. \n\nMonarchy is the most stable form of government. It has existed for thousands of years. Compared to monarchy all other forms of government were incredibility short lived. And just look at modern democracies how the political discours radicalises itself and becomes extremely toxic. Look at countries like the US how much both sides hate each other and how this makes the country in able to act. Everything becomes politicised. The entire society turns against itself. Democracy is incredibly instable and will not be able to sustain itself for thousands of years as monarchy has. \n\nThere are hundreds more arguments for monarchy but those are a few big ones. If you are interested I can give you a few more arguments and provide you with a few sources. I hope I was able to show you that monachism is a serious political position with political philosophy supporting it and not just European sentimentalusm.')

She could have pointed out times when he may have supported policies causing these kind of issues, or laid a ground work for how to start working together since Ted Cruz is not in a great spot in the current public eye so he may have been more willing to discuss.  \n\nOf course, that\'s not wat Twitter is.  Twitter is a source for entertainment which is why politicians using it for anything more than raising awareness for current events is nonsense to me.
