Also it seems like I just began to write a wall of text to explain the libleft position on those 3 words so I guess the meme was accurate with all its imperfection because the meme ask a definition of the political value with only one  word that could mean basicaly anything depending of the interpretation we make. The fact is that the libleft inpretation of those words is more true and more useful that the one each other quadrant use. the concept of liberty for exemple in the libright interpretation, would be more accurately described as the dictatorship of the capital because the liberty they defend is based on the value of the property each person possesses, as such the interest of those who own nothing would not be respected and only those who can use their capital will rightfully influence the way society work in this paradigm, thus the level of liberty each person enjoy would vary according to their relative wealth so tbe less wealthy would not have the same liberty that the rich would enjoy. liberty without equality is the tyrany of the powerful. Secondly the order autright defend is, in fact, chaos. The autright claim that their subjective perspective of what normality should be the eternal order and they never acknoledge that their idea doesnt correspond to reality and thus the "order" they create always have to fight against the reality that the world doesnt comply with the delusion they live in,  because of the idea that they protect   their order against the true order in which every progressive movement strive toward, they create and entertain the dialectical struggle between reality and the illusion of a pure tradition, creating chaos, a struggle between the old and the new and a war between reality and the narative that keep them in power. A true order would be to accept and evolve with the world and its diversity rather than to fight for the violent dominion of one\'s subjective archetype over the other. In fact, Anarchy is order! damn I\'m tired please for the rest imagined that I continue my rant by explaining how equality need freedom to be useful and that equality alone without taking needs into account contradictory and that only free and equal access to the means and the fruits of production is can bring a more healthy type of equality. to conclude not only is liberty, order and equality not contradictory they have to evolve in unity with one another to realy bring the best of each concept and the libleft position is the only that acknowledge and impleament them as such. The Autright oppose Progress with Order and only create Chaos. The Libright oppose Equality with Liberty and Autleft oppose Liberty with Equality and both can only create Tyrany. Only with libleft   can Liberty and Equality, Anarchy and communism, colaborate and thrive, and bring true Order by evolving with the world instead of opposing it.')

('Libertarian Left', 'Kanye West has become the president\n\n**November 4th, 2020**\n\nAgainst all odds, Kanye West has won the presidency through the sheer power of his fanboys/girls and his new release "Like a President ft. LonelyIsland".\n\nAs the day comes to an end, many news outlets speculate on his policies, replaying old clips of comedic and nonsensical things.\n\n-\t- - \n\n**November 7th, 2020**\n\nKanye West has completely shut the borders, no one in, no one out, under the guise of coronavirus containment, research begins on a method of obscuring the united states.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**February 1st, 2021**\n\nBy now people are wondering what Kanye�s grand plan is, a few memes have broken out, comparing the situation to Wakanda, but no one bats an eye.\n\nThe right doesn�t care what he does, as the economy is booming thanks to kanye practically resurrecting the economy with his new merch �U.S. Freedom Bonds�.\n\nNo one knows how they�re made, but owning just one makes you feel incredibly powerful, as though you were young again.\n\nHowever, Kanye only sells them in small batches.\n\nDue to this, billionaires have invested upwards of trillions of dollars into making sure they get their hands on love bonds, with the US government being the only one who has any idea what they�re made out of, causing counterfeits and copycats to be laughable.\n\nThe Left lets him do what he wants as he recently came out as gay, polyamorous, and even discovered a new sexuality, his male partner, Tyler Demetri Joonies, is an astrophysicist in the year 2054, even though Kanye has not met him, he pronounces his love to him and comes out as the first Futur-sexual.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**December 25th, 2021**\n\nThe U.S. has completely paid off their debt to china, healthcare is free not because Kanye set up an elaborate social net to catch people who can�t afford insurance, but because his Freedom Bonds earned so much money that hospitals have enough money to run at full capacity for 300 years.\n\nResearch into methods of turning the US invisible are still ongoing, but with promising results.\n\nA rich business man named [REDACTED] managed to smuggle a Freedom Bond out of the US, through his private yacht.\n\nTo his surprise, as soon as he reached international waters the bond lost its brilliant color, and he no longer felt young, in fact, he felt as though he was older than he was.\n\nHe begins plans to fund the reverse engineering of a freedom bond.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**July 4th, 2022**\n\nPresident Kanye has withdrawn all military troops, auxiliary or otherwise, stating that �The United States have become too disconnected on a global scale to continue these dangerous war games�\n\nDespite what seems to be a sudden withdrawing of troops, there are no insurrections, and the middle east has miraculously become more stable.\n\nFreedom.Inc, established to reverse engineer freedom bonds, has made significant progress, although it is unable to determine the makeup, they conclude that they are made with 100% Local Materials, hence why they don�t work outside of the US.\n\nKanye declares that the project to close off america via �an invisibility cloak� has concluded, with less than satisfactory results.\n\nWill instead be funding Clean Nuclear Energy.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**April 17th, 2023**\n\nNuclear Power Plants have popped up across the nation, adding free electricity and utilities to the benefits of being an American, alongside healthcare, simply because electricity is so cheap that it costs more to withhold it than it does to let everyone have it.\n\nFreedom Inc have discovered the secret behind the legendary Freedom Bonds, its the will of the American People.\n\nUsing an energized form of the American �Spirit� Kanye was able to create mythical bonds which restore vigor to anyone, they suspect he harvests it during his numerous rallies and tours.\n\nEveryone outside of America has been declared a 1st-ish world country, with many people, rich and poor alike, clamoring to be let in.\n\nEveryone is proud of anything slightly close to America, clothes and appliances rumored to be made in america (since america exports nothing) are regarded as rare collectibles, similar to a beatles record.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**August 29th, 2023**\n\nKanye�s first term is beginning to end, but everyone knows that a re-election would be a landslide, America is positively glowing, and even has China owing them vast sums of money.\n\nFreedom Bonds only get stronger as the american spirit is raised higher and higher by their enigmatic leader, but replications are unsuccessful.\n\nIn an effort to combat him, the Democrats and the Republicans have merged into one party, the Republicrats, even with this, they stand no chance.\n\nThe whole world envied America, but soon, things would change, Kanye had been watching Black Panther everyday since his presidency, and he knew he needed a way to block America off from the world.\n\nLuckily, there were a massive amount of nuclear power plants sitting around the country.\n\nKanye had a plan.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 21st, 2024**\n\nConsidering the circumstances, it was actually a tossup as to who would win the presidency, with the Republicrats running on a direct, yet split platform.\n\nAs though they had been frankenstiened together, their policies were a mix between far left and far right. \n\nSurprisingly, 40% loved it.\n\nHowever, Kanye had an ace up his sleeve.\n\n-\t- -\n\n**September 23rd, 2024**\n\nMillions of powerplants across the nation had malfunctioned, practically erupting in radiation, with the estimated death tolls to be somewhere in the real of 4 million.\n\nKanye responded like a hardened president, containing the disasters, safeproofing the unaffected plants, and launching an investigation into what caused the disaster. \n\nTo the rest of the world, the US had exploded, with reported deaths of 100 million.\n\nAmerica went from being the 1st world country to a 3rd world country overnight.\n\nSpecial clearance was needed to even fly over the once glorious states, and you can forget about landing, a select few representatives were chosen to brave the dangers of the US, each country sending them with methods to resist the radiation which had surely overtaken the land.\n\nBut, to the Americans, nothing of that scale happened. \n\nKanye had it controlled so well it was almost as though he had prepared specifically for this.\n\nTruthfully, only around 500k people died, most being prisoners or so elderly that even freedom bonds couldn�t preserve them for much longer.\n\nThe investigation finished, arresting prominent members of the Republicrats Party for orchestrating a coup.\n\nKanye had achieved his Wakanda, and he still had 4 more years to be president.\n\nThis truly is the best timeline.')

Unfortunately we had already bought the apparatus from another friend of the mayor for 100x market rate. So now we are paying another friend of the mayor above market rate to store the apparatus in their warehouse while we figure out what to do with it (probably sell it for scraps to another friend of the mayor at below market rate). \n\nIn all we have spent $400,000,000 on the new park which consists of a field and a bench.
