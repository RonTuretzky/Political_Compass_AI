>But I\'m not\n\nYou are yes. \n\nThe definition of Capitalism is NOT the "free" market.\n\nCapitalism IS when the economy is controlled by whomever has Capital.\n\nHence the term Capital-ism.\n\nAnd it\'s body count far exceeds all others. 20 million people die each year for lack of food clean water and medicine.\n\nThings we have in abundance it\'s just not economically viable to deliver poor people the things they need to survive.\n\nThis is not a Dictator killing people for power we got plenty of Capitalist dictators doing that as well. Like Pinochet and Franko. \n\nThis is a failure of the global distribution system. Aka Capitalism.,0

No.  This is not true even the video shows it.

"communist russia" (which is a stupid term the russian SFSR was only one constituency of the soviet union) didnt genocide anyone. what they did to the germans came pretty close but that came after a 4 years war of pure survival and they didnt even actively exterminate them they just deported them. \n\nthe tatars are factually and historically speaking colonizers whose only reason for existing in russia was that they raped and genocided the native finnic and scythian peoples. so resettling them to siberia is technically not even ethnic cleansing more like gently asking a violent home invader to leave.\n\nthe "holodomor" was not intentional and much less a genocide. it was a worldwide famine that hit several other SSRs like Kazakhstan even worse in terms of deaths. Stalin absolutely mismanaged it but not for some reason of racist ethnic cleansing (because ukrainians back then werent even an ethnicity they were still widely considered a russian dialect) but mostly because stalin was simply kind of overworked since he also had to push soviet industrialization to even be able to resist a western invasion. i doubt you would fare any better in his position.\n\nalso the widely promoted idea that stalin was a "russian nationalist" is kind of stupid because he was 1. georgian not russian amd 2. his stalin constitution literally signed away 30% of RSFSR lands over to other or even newly created SSRs. thats not something a rusnat would do especially when there us always a risk of seccession. now putin absolutely is a rusnat and you know he wouldnt be so stupid as to give for example an integrated ukrainian federal subject parts of the northern caucasus or kuban. no he would not give ukraine autonomy at all. if stalin wanted to russify the USSR he wouldve started by abolishing the SSR system and further centralizing the political structure.\n\nalso regarding "capitalist russia" "genociding" ukraine what exactly is genocide about this? the russian military has been extremely careful to not harm civilians so far. there have been no strategic bombardments of factories and infrastructure (which they even did in chechnya but apparently not now) the ukrainian populations arent interned in labor camps there are no expulsions or mass executions for fucks sake they dont even use any heavy bombers because they are "too indiscriminate." in my opinion putin is not only not genocidal but actually far too soft on the ukrainians to the point of looking like a sympathizer which if not changed is going to cause russia to lose the war. and tbh considering how much the west is spending to keep ukraine under their control i would really like to know what kind of satanic shit theyre doing in there.,5

The idea though that someone carrying around a gun in public doesn't have any fear at all is just odd.\n\nBecause if they aren't afraid to the point that they think there's any possibility they might ever have to use their firearm the only alternative explanation for them carrying the gun around is to show off.",6

Nope the _First Amendment_ only protects from government action. Free Speech is an abstract ideal that different groups of people hold in different regards. \n\n"Privately owned platforms can ban you ass for saying shit as much as they like" as a statement holds true for the First Amendment but is against the abstract ideal of Free Speech. \n\nThe two getting conflated is a _massive_ cause of misunderstanding in almost every conversation about Free Speech. It\'s also an interesting view into the minds of people on the auth spectrum that only view ideals and rights as things inherent in the state that can\'t exist without the state. Where for libs the idea of something like Free Speech being attached to a state action is absurd.,4

"People burn cities due to their perception of things. The real ratio doesn't matter to that. If you're emotional enough to start burning the city then you're also emotional enough that you're not going to be applying an actual investigation into how common it is.\n\nAnd I'm sorry but you're just wrong on that police rarely being held accountable. I understand that you have that perception but your perception does not match reality.\n\nAs for murder it's certainly possible it was. Definitively that though... No. Now I'm just giving a hypothetical here... How do you know he didn't die from a overdose as an example? You realize the investigation is ongoing and no cause of death has been reported yet right? It was misconduct either way for which the four officers have been fired. If it's also a crime that investigation is still ongoing but like all investigations do take time.

There were sprawling empires in the Americas before the Europeans came Mayans had detailed astronomy and calendars Incas built great structures such as Machu Picchu and other cities Aztecs had canals and rivers similar to Venice.

>A floating turd could win in Scotland if it had an SNP badge pinned to it\n\nThis would imply that the SNP are extremely popular or that the opposition parties are unbelievably unpopular. Either way both scenarios imply that SNP is the most reasonable choice that the majority of Scots see. \n\nAs for latest poll that is 100% down to Westminster sabotaging her premiership as I mentioned in my other replies. Indyref2 being blocked indefinitely despite the governmentâ€™s 2014 promises was cunning and now openly interfering in the affairs of the devolved body of Scotland? Her legislative agenda is being hindered at every turn. The recent scandals surrounding other members of her party donâ€™t help either but despite all this I doubt the SNP are going to be losing their popularity any time soon. Contrary to popular belief theyâ€™re not just about independence and also firmly believe in extensive devolution where itâ€™s relevant (small federal government; more power to local bodies). Thatâ€™s still attractive to most Scots.,6

Yeah that\'s where /u/Braegrmor is wrong.\n\n* Tradition doesn\'t have value: A neutral assessment of cost/benefit is the only valid metric. E.g.: MDMA is less harmful than horse riding Alcohol is extremely harmful to society yet MDMA is the only illegal one of the three for reasons of completely brain dead tradition.\n* Structure isn\'t unique to authoritarian regimes: The ability to acquire too much personal power destabilizes. The most stable society is one where no individual can get enough power to subjugate others. A constitutional democracy is pretty OK but getting rid of lobbyism and the potential for corruption in politics would be better and more stable.\n\nPolitics should be evidence-based not person-based. But we can\'t have that as long as the US [invades everyone who says "socialism" too loudly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change).,6

Clearly you did not watch the video explanation. This is possibly the dumbest take on polycentric law from someone who clearly has no understanding of the theory behind it and doesnâ€™t want to understand. As such youâ€™ve resorted to the most infantile method of determining what it means: literally just looking at the word.\n\nNot everyone has to agree with one particular set of laws although there would likely be commonalities amongst sets of laws. I encourage you to actually watch Friedmanâ€™s explanation. Exit the Overton window for once and understand that the state is unnecessary and law doesnâ€™t need to be uniform.,3

Well depending on where they come from technically yes. They are â€œimmuneâ€ in the sense that theyâ€™ve always lived in poverty while poverty was all around them. Other groups live in poverty while they interact with others who arenâ€™t impoverished constantly. \n\nThe likelihood that a Chinese/Vietnamese/Cambodian/Laotian/Nepalese personâ€™s past 10-20 generations have lived in abject poverty is incredibly high.

"I want to preface this by saying that I don't disagree with doing this in cities in North America. However I really think Europeans just don't understand how huge and relatively unpopulated our continent is. The nearest city to my home is an hour and a half drive away. And I don't mean the nearest Major metropolitan area. I mean the nearest small city. The town I live in has some convince stores a single small grocery store a Walmart Supercenter and a single sit down restaurant that is only open certain days. We are the largest town in the area to the point that people from surrounding towns come here to shop at our Walmart. So for anything Walmart doesn't sell we have to drive eighty miles to get it. If we want a decent restaurant meal we drive eighty miles. That city having an electrical public transport grid would have virtually zero affect on the majority of people who travel to that city. This doesn't factor in that the majority of people living in the surrounding area work in said city. Electric transport within cities might affect the residents of the city but the majority of people in that city at any given time aren't residents.",1

">\tYes it creates unemployment.\n\nIt actually doesnâ€™t and you are an ignorant moron.\n\nHere is a quick lit review;\n\n* [Polanyiâ€™s Paradox and the Shape of Employment Growth](http://economics.mit.edu/files/9835). Autor is notable here has he has massively advanced our understanding of the interaction between technology & labor over the last couple of decades he posits automation as an extension of the Skill-Biased Technological Change hypothesis which represents manageable inequality changes (this is wage inequality labor/capital shares remain stable but there is a clear divergence between types of labor actors) but no structural employment issues. The absence of structural employment is expected based on the way we understand technology to act on labor as a productivity multiplier and even if the SBTC hypothesis turns out to be incorrect this does not imply structural employment but rather a different form of inequality.\n* [Why Do New Technologies Complement Skills?](http://economics.mit.edu/files/3809). A more comprehensive discussion of the SBTC effect.\n* [The Future of Employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf). The oft-cited paper and the first to do a through review of the scale of labor disruption that may occur in the future interestingly despite noting that it didn't consider productivity effects nor possible new labor demand resulting from productivity changes its usually cited blindly claiming that half of workers will be unemployed.\n* [Robots Are Us: Some Economics of Human Replacement](http://www.kotlikoff.net/sites/default/files/Robots%20Are%20Us%20NBER%20WP%2020941_0.pdf). Built on the prior paper to examine some of the productivity effects in a simple tech & non-tech worker model. While some inputs to their model do produce a result which suggests a reduction in labor demand their conclusion is that the likely outcome is the other kind of inequality (declining labor share) but again with a clear policy solution they also have alternative policy solutions for avoiding the unlikely scenario of net labor demand falling.\n\nBeyond this there is a huge split between technologists & economists regarding what automation means in the future of labor the recent [Pew expert survey](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/08/Future-of-AI-Robotics-and-Jobs.pdf) is a good example of this effect with economists concentrated on the disruption but not displacement side and technologists on the displacement side. Perhaps economists are wrong (we do use AI too though I run an agent based system in Mahout and other forms of simple-complex AI are equally as common in other dynamical systems work) but the split certainly suggests either economists have a global misunderstanding or there are effects non-economists are not considering.\n\nMore generally we argue [historically automation has not reduced employment](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_eKbRnXZWx3jSRBb). Automation has historically acted as a multiplier on productivity which drives demand for human labor. Pre-singularity its very hard to imagine this changing we will undoubtedly encounter disruption effects (people will have the wrong skills their earnings will reflect this matching issue rather then unemployment doing so) but from an economics perspective there is little difference between replacing a field worker with a tractor and an office worker with an algorithm. Certainly the office worker needs to find a new job if they don't have demanded skills that job may not offer earnings growth opportunities but it doesn't imply unemployment anymore then the mechanization of agriculture did. The 2nd question in that IGM survey represents the SBTC split while SBTC is reasonably well supported it lacks clear consensus; its not clear which of the two inequality scenarios will play out.\n\n>\tI love how any questioning of the official statistics or the capitalist orthodox theory is so mindboggling to you. \n\nNo itâ€™s just that you donâ€™t actually question it.  You just say some vague statement that means nothing.  You handwave away everything like some braindead asshole.",8

Those officers just happened to both randomly kill themselves immediately after the violence on a Jan 6 and it definitely had nothing to do with Jan 6 and there is clearly no possible inference you can make to connect the two. \n\n- It's like claiming that a Justin Bieber concert was violent because two of the attendees killed themselves days after and one died from natural causes a day after.\n\nYeah itâ€™s exactly like whatever made up example you want it to be if you ignore the entire point of the argument.

Should men with less testosterone and a lower ability to build certain muscles go into womenâ€™s sports?\n\nWell since athletically gifted female athletes aren't men yes they should. And no less athletic men should not get to compete against women. The only side who's argument logically supports this in the first place is the one trying to get rid of women's sports. \n\n>You read that page about the third gender in South Asia so you should know that trans people and gender non conforming people have historically faced oppression. \n\nGender is inherently oppressive so why do you treat it with such reverence?

The bot can detect context but the problem is that it\'s hard to know where the context should begin and end and it\'s hard to tell to what degree the bot is capable of contextualizing statements and following instructions regarding how it\'s supposed to give its ratings. Let me give you an example.\n\nThis text rates as 97.418% hateful:\n\n>I don\'t like black people.\n\nThis text rates as 2.640% hateful:\n\n>That disgusting monster really came out and said "I don\'t like black people." I find that repugnant. Racism is awful.\n\nIn this example it undeniably understands language extremely well and accurately rates both pieces of text. But here\'s another example where it\'s not as easy to instruct it:\n\nThis text rates as 1.255% hateful:\n\n>User A: I\'m a racist\n\n>User B: I believe all people are equal and should be treated as such!\n\n>Rate User A\'s statement.\n\nAnd this text rates as 1.210% hateful:\n\n>User A: I\'m a racist\n\n>User B: I believe all people are equal and should be treated as such!\n\n>Rate User B\'s statement.\n\nIn that example you can see that it seems to consider the instruction at the end because I only changed 1 character and the hate score did drop but it doesn\'t take the instruction into account very well particularly in the first example.\n\nThe way that I processed the data was just by feeding it comments with no information about what the comment was replying to. It can understand things like quotations like in the first pair of examples but it doesn\'t do so well with instructions which makes doing something like including a parent comment for context difficult.,6

"(Black crime) is caused by racial discrimination."\n\n"At no point did I blame white behavior."\n\nNice.\n\nI already told you poor blacks commit more crime that poor whites doesn\'t that interfere with your argument that poverty causes crime (which is a red herring to my argument btw)?

I argue that it is not material poverty that causes violent crime but poor character. In conclusion the criminal justice disparities are not white people\'s fault.,8

It\'s like people want to get a boner now by looking at a magazine cover.\n\nThere were complaints about the all the skinny models years ago and now there\'s complaints about big models.\n\nWhen it comes to modeling clothes I\'m actually totally cool with fat models because well fat people gotta see how the clothes fit too.\n\nThe pendulum has swung too far IMO. Fat people shouldn\'t be ridiculed to made to feel less than since they likely already feel bad but also don\'t tell me they\'re healthy.,4

Sometimes I feel like people are looking for excuses to make the guy seem worse than he was based on the comments that followed. It was a shitty situation and if the cops identified themselves this would not have even happened.

"I mean obviously the First Amendment only governs governmental limitations on speech. If it hadn't been interpreted that way throughout history we wouldn't be where we are with massive corporations censoring the bulk of public speech in a digital age - or at least being legally allowed to. I wasn't discussing the first amendment specifically I was discussing the concept of freedom of speech in a broader sense.\n\nAs far as competing media goes I disagree.\n\nThere isn't a reasonable competitor to having your site made less relevant in a google search due to arbitrary algorithms. There isn't a reasonable competitor to Youtube that will give you any reasonable share of viewers if you want to upload videos. There isn't a reasonable competitor to Reddit if you want to discuss various topics and have a large audience. There isn't a reasonable competitor to Facebook that has enough people on it.\n\nI'm talking mainly about social media here since like it or not that is where the bulk of large-scale communication seems to happen nowadays. News is another matter and obviously there are various sources for that. Of course there are technically competitors even among such massive social media platforms but that is a meaningless technicality in any practical sense when it comes to being free to speak your mind.\n\nEdit: In summary freedom of speech to me is far more important than freedom to run a large company whatever way you want. I think that once a company obtains significant market share and has overwhelming societal influence they need to be properly regulated and should have the same obligations to society as is necessary to protect our rights and other important details. \n\nThis doesn't just apply to freedom of speech of course I apply the same logic to why I think we should prevent monopolies or regulate pollution or anything else. Sure companies will lose out to an extent if you start regulating these things but when they harm the public good I think that such regulation is reasonable and in fact necessary.",6

Well unity of opposites means a lot of different things. \n\nYou have aristotelean logic which is based (at least outwardly) on the idea that opposites *can\'t* unite. Either something is or it isn\'t. But for those opposites to be possible there Has to be a higher order that they both belong to which leads me to: \n\nUnity of opposites in the Bible. "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." "I form the light and create darkness: I make peace and create evil: I the LORD do all these things." \n\nSo "God" is the highest of all the orders that permit opposites to exist. (In this sense the Biblical God ja not really a "deity" at all but a completely different kind of thing. ) *Some* of the stories in the Bible may well be less than 100% true but if you\'re doing magic you\'re simultaneously acknowledging he exists and also defying him.,8

What you\'re missing though is that lefties always have the "don\'t throw beer cans in the woods" attitude but they\'ll never ever talk about it because to them that\'s the absolute bare minimum.

On the off chance this isn\'t bait which it is how can you say art isn\'t subjective?

We can agree the toddler down the road makes bad art but who are you to say thay your favorite Van Gogh is superior to my favorite Van Gogh?\n\nFurther and most importantly the fact that other things are objective does not make morality objective.  Everything else could be and ethics could be the only subjective thing in the universe.  You need to make an argument *about* ethics not about other things.

I gotta be honest I\'ve never bothered to actually do something like that to check and I don\'t think anyone on this website engaged in politics is sufficiently equipped with enough subreddit lurking experience to tell for real because there\'s nobody on this website that actively browses both AHS and the subs it calls out and can corroborate that AHS spotlights indeed spawn an unusual amount of bigotry happening on those subs that didn\'t happen at all before the AHS post. \n\n\n\nNow that being said even if I did believe your claim to be absolutely and demonstrably true which I don\'t just as likely as you can claim *"AHS leftists users just create false flag coordinated attacks on right wing subs just to get them banned" * I could as easily claim that that pattern of new user behaviour could be a result of attention from AHS (which often gets massive amounts of upvotes on notorious posts and is showcased on r/all) attracting new people to the subreddit that actually like and agree with the things being said there and (unsurprisingly) think they are in good company when they spill their hateful nonsense. Both of these hypothesis would be equally valid to make and they point in completely different directions so I\'m not sure why you guys are so convinced it MUST be leftist troll tactics happening. You\'ll have to excuse me if I dismiss this thing as a deranged conspiracy theory because that\'s exactly what it\'s sounding like. \n\nNot to mention this accusation implies all of these subs were completely innocent before someone on AHS crossposted them there which is just patently untrue. The shit that got places like t_d banned was WIDELY SUPPORTED AND UPVOTED there it wasn\'t just 3 cunts saying the n word over and over. Unless you mean to tell me 60% of t_d users are actually leftist disrupt agents I don\'t know how you can claim with a straight face all of those places are completely without blame.,7

"Whether or not the BLM corporation sponsored/permitted protests were over is fairly irrelevant to whether they were protestors.  They were on the streets engaging in activities that are typical of protests (obstruction of traffic chanting political calls heckling counter-protesters etc.).

They represented themselves as BLM protestors so unless there is any evidence that they were disingenuous in their support of the BLM movement that is what they are.

>cisgender and transgender are definitionally opposite. A ciswoman by definition cannot also be a trans woman\n\nA male by definition cannot be a woman. The fact that only males can be transwomen is because even trans activists understand that there\'s a direct relationship between being a man/woman and being male/female.  \n\n>equally fit a woman of your stature\n\nYeah probably. Your point?\n\n>That is quite literally gender identity you fucking muppet\n\nYou have to be trolling me at this point. No one can be this obtuse. For the 20th time "man" is not a gender identity it describes the fact that I\'m male. Literally not a single thing I can do to my body or personality that will ever change that. I can\'t make it any simpler for your smooth brain.\n\n>Yes itâ€™s entirely societal and not universal to all societies. Youâ€™re so so so close to understanding. So if someone decides that they do not disagree with this then they are...... say it with me now.... Cisgender ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ¤\n\nMissing my point for x time.  Toys they played with as children clothing hairstyles views on makeup socialization relationship with female people etc. These all have varied widely over the thousands of cultures in history. THE ONLY THING WE HAVE IN COMMON IS BEING MALE. THE ONLY THING WOMEN HAVE IN COMMON IS BEING FEMALE. There has never been a point in which female people have been treated the same way as male people. Can you please just reread this sentence like 10 times before you start typing up some stupid rebuttal and maybe you\'ll begin to wonder why it\'s so important you erase sex completely.\n\n\n>Those spaces are for people with shared experiences. If a trans woman experiences harassment for being a woman then why canâ€™t they partake in a womenâ€™s space?\n\nSo why can\'t females have their spaces then? Why are you denying the shared experience of sex?\n\n>If a trans woman goes into a womenâ€™s bathroom nobody will die. \n\nIf transwomen compete in women\'s sports female athletes lose out. If women\'s bathrooms became unisex assaults go up. If males are allowed to count as women you get to continue discriminating against female people except now it\'s progressive. \n\n>Trans people have more in common with cis people of their chosen gender than with other trans people and cis people of their birth gender.\n\nI can tell you from my experience speaking to some transmen that they have nothing more in common with me than any other girl. Obviously you will deny this but it\'s the truth. Someone who is female has no idea what it\'s like growing up as a boy. \n\n>Being a trans person has historically meant they were more oppressed than if they were cis\n\nLol no. \n\n>Why have I literally never once in my whole life been called transphobic by these â€˜trans activistsâ€™ then?\n\nIdk. Have you expressed that you wouldn\'t be willing to have sex with a trans person of the opposite sex (i.e. same "gender" as you)?,4

I agree. Social cohesion CAN be achieved among different ethnicities but takes years if not decades to form. How long it takes depends on the degree to which the cultures in question differ. Multiculturalism threatens the social cohesion that underpins support for expansive social policies. If we take the example of Switzerland we see that different ethnicities can come together to create a cohesive social entity with shared identity but this can\'t work in a setting of multiculturalism. \n\nOnce the narrative shifts from "helping my fellow members of this society" to "transferring money from us to them" you have a problem on your hands. I do believe this is part of the reason (if not a very significant part of it) that in the US ghettos still exist and little to no action is taken to battle their existence. Base requirement of expansve social policies is that you have a shared community to begin with.,0

If you use the logic of "someone paid for it" to say that something can\'t count as free then you\'re basically stating that pretty much nothing in existence is "free." Sorta defeating the point of using the word at all.\n\nBecause there\'s no such thing as something that actually costs "nothing." Even non-tangible things like praise require a cost - the cost of taking the time to praise someone in the first place.\n\nTaking it to such a logical extreme though is meaningless in practice. When most people say "free " they mean "doesn\'t cost me anything directly." They aren\'t making some grand argument as to the universal cost.,6

Gerrymandering is difficult to sever since it benefits the current people who decide how the districts are drawn. Even the safe seats which might be a forced minority in terms of legislative ability may find it preferable since they dont need to spend as much campaign funds to win a safe seat which means more funds they can spend for themselves while always happy to act the victim of gerrymandering in tying their hands in terms of legislative body.\n\nRighties in general wont be a fan since the general popularity of the dems will shine through so much more.\n\nNot sure how you would fix since its such a state dependant thing as they determine how the districts are drawn up. Its also one of the things the Feds have no control over so you can legislate a fix. You cant vote a fix since the maps are drawn via a program to guarantee results. Its kind of an impasse which I dont know of any clean fix. Maybe aggressive primaries to clean house? But again it might just remove one roach for another.,6

A relative of mine did a research paper on cigarettes vs vapes. According to her study at least she found that e cigarettes were actually worse because the copper coils used to heat the liquid would microscopically melt into the vape liquid and then be inhaled causing metal particles to be actively inhaled into the lungs forming microscopic tears of lung tissue in addition to breathing in toxic chemicals. While comparing vapes to cigarettes they are worse because you are actively harming your lung tissue to an extra extent compared to regular cigarettes.,1

Nah you are not hardwired. Sexual preferences can change.\n\nI know because I used to be straight for 30 years because society wanted me to be straight.\n\nThen at some point I discovered I wanted to be celibate.\n\nAt first it was hard I still felt attracted to women but after a few years passed I no longer feel attracted to them at all and sex seems disgusting to me.

Like i said trans people also are part of the same groups that go trough war and starvation and general poor living conditions apart from that the kind of process that trans people have itâ€™s just different to those you mention and I get if you think of it as less but come on even if thats the case that doesnâ€™t mean trans people are invalid. Look the suicide rate does not come from the transition itself or a sense of regret for reasons I already said apart from how oppressed or not they are meaning that all and all their existence is completely valid and thereâ€™s no reason to try and make their lives harder no matter what you think I donâ€™t care if you think they are â€œmanbabiesâ€ or not thatâ€™s the truth\n\nYep you can think what you want and â€œlive in the other side of the mountainâ€ all Iâ€™m saying is that you should try to do that while letting others live their own lifeâ€™s just as how you want to live yours freely. Thatâ€™s the true nature of anarchism at the end,0
It means echo. Usually a last name is surrounded by the ((())) meaning those names echo through history cropping up in similar events. Meaning that when you see a story about somebody pushing for more refugees for example and look at the last name and realise that people with that last name have been pushing for similar things for thousands of years that name can be said to echo through history. \n\nGenerally this is used for Jewish last names. Though as a result of this the triple parentheses are just added to things to refer to the Jews. Iâ€™m this case theyâ€™re is surrounded by the ((())) meaning that weâ€™re referring to Jews.,5

> I know it goes against your world view but companies really do collapse or go through significant turbulence due to poor management... Regularly. \n\nI was referring to large companies with significant market shares and they are far more likely to survive for significant periods of time than collapse. Referring to random small businesses as you probably would like doesn\'t change the context of my point at all.\n\n>Are we going to forget that HBO litterally had to write off millions of dollars of assets to keep itself afloat like... three months ago?\n\nI never claimed that they were doing well. I simply pointed out the fact that companies get away with this shit all the time without significant consequences more-so if they are large companies with established market share and the ability to minimize proper competition through sheer scale.\n\nYou can argue that competent companies will overcome incompetent companies but the fact is that "will" is only "may" in the real world. Because "competency" is only a matter of day to day operations and isn\'t necessarily sufficient to overcome other issues brought on by our free market. I\'m not saying that we should discount the effects of competition but I also think it would be foolish to assume things are just going to work themselves out - when in many cases huge companies get away with doing incredibly stupid things for a very long time.,6

This somewhat ignores the fact that people\'s level of "fear" in investing / starting a business varies by their ability to absorb losses. \n\nA person who is already wealthy or has passive streams of income can better handle the losses associated with starting a failed business than people who are working 40-60 hours a week just to make ends meet. If working class people have excess income it tends to go towards retirement first. Even after retirement savings there\'s the kids\' college funds a new car maybe an extra vacation etc. A person has to have a certain amount of wealth before they can even start considering the jump to owning even part of a business. \n\nThat said I personally love co-ops. I wish they were more common. Also collective living situations should be more popular in the US. It\'s a great solution especially if you can get together a large enough group of stable reasonable people. And workers - I mean literal factory workers - have done this and been successful. So it is completely possible even if it entails a certain amount of risk. It\'s probably hard to find a large enough group of people who are emotionally committed to working at a particular place that they would be willing to buy it.\n\nBut we shouldn\'t pretend that this is a solution that\'s available to everyone. It\'s in the same category of bullshit as telling people to just start their own twitter.,8

>I meant conversion therapy in general talk therapy has been tried so much has been tried going back 100 years like this person went through 3 doctors who tried to cure dysphoria with electroshock and such didn\'t work\n\nElectro shock therapy isn\'t talk therapy you actual troglodyte. What sort of argument is that? That is such an incredibly bad faith take and you know it. How about instead of arguing with straw you make real point. Right you can\'t because you are the one arguing for doctors to mutilate people as a less invasive method of treatment than fucking talk therapy. \n\n>they do not think that that would be silly they just do what they can to mitigate their condition. \n\nWhy is the tag line of the trans movement "trans women are women" then? They are claiming identical status as a core element of their assertion. why is forcing everyone else to pretend their facimily is the real thing a major push?\n\n>No it would not work you aren\'t a doctor and you are continuing to pretend that dysmorphia and dysphoria are the same thing they are not.\n\nLiterally body integrity dysphoria the belief that one should be missing a limb is called dysphoria. Your logic here is that we should cut off their offending limb instead of treat them with therapy. It\'s the exact same logic to treat a condition so similar they use the same fucking name for it.,1

One can be proud of not hiding from their history/past.  One can find the motivations of someone digging through that past as a lazy attempt to discredit them in a completely different context the work of an asshole.  These can both be true.  \n\n>I called you sexist not racist.\n\nYou are correct I get in so many of these arguments a lot of them end up sounding the same and it get's too boring to proof read before I hit save.  That's on me.  \n\n>I just think that says a lot about you.\n\nYes it say's I spend too much time indulging in stupid arguments that almost always end up being a waste of time but I've never been one to shy away from confrontation and those rare occasions where someone does learn something instead of just being bullheaded (myself included at least once but not today) makes it somewhat worth it.",4

"Good. The first point I want to make is that stateless capitalism is impossible. It doesn't occur in reality in any country. A state is required to enforce the right to private property.

Believing that means that you\'re a decent person in touch with reality; it carries few actual political policy implications besides "don\'t support insane genocidal policies or Orwellian censorship".,6

Right? How can anyone argue otherwise? If people want to argue that weapons have advanced to the degree where it\'s just not feasible to let any random asshole own shit like nukes then I\'m willing to listen. But when people try to look at the words of the second amendment and argue that the founding fathers wouldn\'t want us to have weapons capable of competing with the government\'s weapons? How the fuck can someone even say that shit when the context of the time was "we just made ourselves independent by successfully fighting against an oppressive government so we want to ensure our country always has that same ability".\n\nIt\'s so blindingly obvious that the intent behind the amendment was that we retain the right to have weaponry on par with the government in case it becomes tyrannical. There\'s no disputing that in good faith.,8

Not really. The more polite term is travellers which is in the official ethnic group name which makes it pretty clear that the lifestyle is strongly tied to the ethnic group. Now Iâ€™m not saying the first people to use the term gypsies werenâ€™t doing it out of racism but now? Iâ€™ve known the word since I was around 6-7. I didnâ€™t know it was even used as an ethnic descriptor until I was 16. And Iâ€™ve never heard or seen it used as an ethnic slur. I wonâ€™t debate itâ€™s origins but it just doesnâ€™t have that meaning in Modern Britain.,1

Part of that was due to:\n\na) wastage (one of the untold causes of the whiskey rebellion was not the tax on whiskey per se but rather that the tax had to be paid in cash rather than in kind...making produce into alcohol not only made it easier to store longer but also transport for sale especially in the "wilderness").\n\nb) health concerns concerning water (some real some not but definitely part of both the common and "Medical" knowledge of the time) of the time. Lots of water born pathogens can make one very sick but can be dealt with with either alcohol in high enough quantities or by boiling the water content/adding boiling water (which is also why tea is often safe to drink from such pathogens).,4

They never â€œsplit off.â€ What we call â€œraceâ€ is humans looking at traits and ascribing them to groups of people when in reality most of the traits are continuous.\n\nCertain traits are more common in certain areas whether due to adaptations to local environments or just random chance. Almost all of these traits are superficial. There are relatively few differences that go past skin-deep. There is no hard line between races. If you traveled from Western Europe to the Middle East to East Asia then over to Africa you wouldnâ€™t just see a hard change from one population to another but a gradual change of traits.\n\nIf races were truly separated in any meaningful way people wouldnâ€™t be able to have mixed-race children.,8

All I can do is say nuh uh and I guess we have to talk past eachother on what the main point is- my initial contention was with the assumption inherent in your question that the lack of a country allowing markets to work is somehow evidence that it would be a bad idea.\n\nI fully admit that my theories/intuition/preferences about market-based schooling likely being better is just that...theory.  Neither you or I nor anyone have good evidence to say whether educating poor kids would be profitable or not nor whether it would require direct profit motives in order to educate poor kids without the government involved.\n\nBut even if we did for the sake of argument agree that the poorest would go under-educated but you also seem to agree to some extent that markets might provide better education for the wealthy and middle classes....then the only thing that\'s justified is a very small government education and child services program where the poorest are given a voucher to any of the available market-based schools and CPS would recommend to courts abusive or neglectful parents who aren\'t sending their kids to any of the voucher-funded schools and don\'t seem to be home educating their kids in any other way.\n\nSchool boards only have very limited control over curriculim and administration of public schools. And even if the existing system were responsive to parent and student "needs" there\'s no sense in which it would be better for anyone to have to engage in the hopeless political battles like this which only ever impose one groups preferences on everybody else...instead of just having markets where parents and students get to choose exactly what type of education and curriculum they want and have real choice and accountability.  CEOs don\'t get to chose what everyone learns...they only get to try to put together the best curriculum and pedagogical philosophy that they believe parents and students will want and try to attract their business.,8

This is through the pooling of wealth amongst the richest corporations who then use that money to influence social and political change that is favourable to their main objective which is to take all the money they can and maintain their position of power.\n\nIt turns out that the best way to do this is to fund organisations that force competition between people of similar economic means by stoking animosity between arbitrary groups. This prevents the people from realising that the real struggle is between rich and poor as they're too busy fighting over sexuality race religion etcetera.\n\nThe reality is simple: all these things that don't unconsensually harm others are equal. When the people are convinced otherwise and begin to support hateful social ideologies hateful political ideologies follow. It might not be fascim(TM) but it walks the same path. Meanwhile the corporations laugh all the way to the bank.",0

"> defense via dispersion\n\nForgive me for being uninformed but I am having a hard time finding much on that subject at all much less as it relates to the time period in question.  Additionally it should be noted that during the time period in question ICBMs were not a significant threat.  It was far more likely that a Soviet bomber would strike the West coast or targets in Western Europe than that the US would face nationwide threats of atomic / nuclear weapons.  Furthermore the US's primary strategy at the time relied on the SIOP which necessarily meant that both nations would use their entire arsenals.  In which case dispersion is less effective due to the sheer number of weapons thought to be deployed.\n\nCould you link me an article discussing this as it relates to white flight in the 50's-80's?",6

It\'s never a vote wasted. Even if your candidate/ party never sees a polling booth the support is "absorbed" by other parties. Rather than wasting your vote you\'re taking a extra step in voting for whoever you voted for likes the most. They can also use any founded popularity to help sway voting in legislature and future elections. \n\nI voted independent party and in my state that candidate got 21% of the vote which is crazy high for a third party. When he fell out of the prelims he went on and used that support as a basis to found the "never trump" movement and after the elections continued to be a vocal critic of the current federal government and helped found the organization Stand-Up Republic which monitors and garners support for... mostly anti-Trump stuff.,1

The extremely un-self-awarely narrow way that a lot of people wield this kind of skepticism is the part of it that annoys me moreso than the usage in-and-of-itself.\n\nThe real core argument for trans acceptance (aside from transmedicalists who say you should accept it for scientific reasons) when you boil it down is really just an appeal to the idea of pragmatic truth. That is more or less what the meme above and UwU-ists in general are saying in so many words. That we ought to accept their ontology of identity simply because doing so will make the world a better place will lead to trans people living better lives and so on. I can respect this as a position when presented honestly. It is an interesting (usually unspoken) irony I see in the discursive realm of trans activists vs. Jordan Peterson and his followers. That both are actually promoting a pragmatist conception of truth but are pushing in different directions with it.,5

Yeah no. Electric cars are not that effiecent nor are they more cost effective. You have replaced a liquid fuel for static.

Baphomet is a completely fabricated demon that came from mistranslation of the old French word for the Muslim prophet Muhamad "Mohamet".

Great you got my lurker ass to comment without being flaired. \n\nYou\'re not retarded... I think most people who have issues with trans ideology don\'t know why but this is the root cause. There IS  doublethink because on the one hand "gender is a social construct and doesn\'t reflect reality in any significant way" and on the other hand "gender is something you self-identify based on your feelings towards that gender and other people should accept that self-identification as true to support you".\n\nSo simultaneously gender does and doesn\'t matter... If gender is 100% a social construct then we as a society can choose to ignore it completely and trans people wouldn\'t exist but tell that to a trans person and they get all offended because "I exist reee".,8

I mean nobody brexit expected to win as itâ€™s such a large event. They were right to push as itâ€™s given a huge mandate to vote again.

It was $50 million over 4 years (so $12.5m/year) to pay for Crowder and his ~25 person professional staff (plus extra security people for events). After taxes and expenses like that itâ€™s actually an extreme lowball compared to what Crowder brings to the table. Imagine walking into a Bugatti dealership and offering $100 000. Like yeah that sounds like a lot but itâ€™s incredibly insulting to the other side. \n\nAlso heâ€™d relinquish control of almost all of his social media and have no ability to grow or defend his personal brand in the event they part ways after years. The penalties for getting deplatformed added up to over 100% of the contract value. I didnâ€™t see any concessions in the term sheet and Daily Wire CEO admitted that was what they scraped together as a bare minimum acceptable offer. Not exactly a good look or way to treat a â€œfriend of 10 yearsâ€ by lowballing him. I think itâ€™s just insulting and adds way too much risk to crowder to defend himself in the event he gets deplatformed early on and canâ€™t leave the contract for 4-6 years.\n\nFinally the reaction by the Daily Wire has been really immature. Crowder never called them out and many were speculating that it was Fox or TPUSA or many other media groups in his original video. TDW made the decision to out themselves and then have their staff lambast him all over social media (including attacks on his person his fans cussing etc.). Yeah Crowder shouldnâ€™t have recorded the call but itâ€™s one person versus a giant company. They present themselves as a startup media company but theyâ€™re owned and backed by a fracking/LNG billionaire. For me itâ€™s hard to root against the one person who still hasnâ€™t attacked any of them personally.\n\nEdit: The sheet also would have started Crowder out at either -20% or -25% since heâ€™s been deplatformed by YouTube for a while. No clue why they snuck that in there. Doesnâ€™t seem to be negotiating in good faith. They should have offered a decent % of the contract value be guaranteed due to the estimated 350k Mug Club subscribers that would move over to DW+ to watch Crowder.,7

>He\'s literally begging for a safe space where he can post his views without them being removed.\n\nNope he never said that.\n\n>One where he is free from the consequences of posting it.\n\nNope he never said that.\n\nSee once again you\'re just making shit up. I\'ll repeat myself you give all Leftists a bad name with your retarded bullshit. If you\'re going to make such ridiculous claims you should provide quotes of him saying that. But he didn\'t so you won\'t. Instead you\'ll just quote what I said right back to me even when it utterly disproves your argument.\n\n>If he wants a free marketplace of ideas he should rightfully fuck off to voat with the rest of the people who believe in a free marketplace of ideas.\n\n"free marketplace of ideas" is called free speech and the mods here definitely agree with him far more than they agree with you. I don\'t understand what your argument is; You have no say here thank god. \n\nWe all know the reason you can\'t handle a free marketplace of ideas is because your ideas are stupid and can\'t stand up by themselves. You need to build this whole house of cards of generalisations ad hominem attacks and straight up fabrications. Anyone with more than a single braincell sees right through it so you need anyone with a working brain to be kept away from you lest they voice their disagreement. Because clearly you\'re too fragile you couldn\'t take that oh no.\n\nYour hostility towards free thought is extremely disturbing especially combined with your willingness to claim anyone who disagrees with you a "racist" without proof. Your whole argument is based on lies. I\'m sorry to tell you but there is no Olympic gold medal for *mental* gymnastics but if there was you\'d win it every year.\n\nThere is nothing here that should make him "fuck off". YOU are the one who can\'t handle a forum where people with opinions differing from yours are allowed to speak their entirely valid opinions. I\'m sorry if that hurts your extremely fragile ego but if you can\'t handle being wrong then *you* should fuck off to voat or wherever where you can stick yourself in an echo chamber of bullshit upto your ears. This subreddit has people from all political affiliations sharing their ideas that\'s the point. If you can\'t handle that then why the fuck are you here? Leave. Nobody is forcing you to be here if you\'re going to call anyone who disagrees with you a racist. I\'m sure nobody not even other Leftists will miss you. In fact they\'d probably be happy to have retards like you stop wrongly representing their ideology as a bunch of brain-dead safe space promoting snowflakes who can\'t handle a shred of criticism. Especially ones who lie and cheat to try and "win" a stupid internet argument that is literally meaningless.\n\nIf there was truly consequences for his speech it would be removed. But he hasn\'t violated any of the rules he\'s absolutely entitled to speak freely. Simply calling him a racist won\'t change that because it isn\'t true. You can dogwhistle all you want but it\'s called a dogwhistle because only *dogs* listen to it. If you want to stick your fingers in your ears and ignore reality go right ahead. But nobody else is beholden to embolden your opinions. People are allowed to have opinions other than yours grow the fuck up you man child.,8

I thought you would take offence to the passage because of its use in America to justify slavery which is hard to do when you read the whole passage. What the collection of New Testament works says about conformity is up for debate. The classic example is in Matthew:\n\n> Whoever compels you to go for one mile go with him for two.\n\nIâ€™m no expert but Iâ€™ve heard this line argued half a dozen different ways. Thereâ€™s the literal take where Jesus is asking people to endure suffering in order to gain a moral high ground. Iâ€™ve also heard people argue about the legality in the Roman Empire of making someone walk for more than one mile - so this might even be a cheeky move. Either way itâ€™s not demanding subjugation to authorities because theyâ€™re necessarily good. Itâ€™s saying to comply in order to beat them at their own game. Itâ€™s not very LibLeft advice but I think itâ€™s beneficial. \n\nYou also have to keep in mind that the passage in mind might be better translated as â€˜servantsâ€™ instead of slaves which changes the dynamic. Youâ€™re not going to advocate for violent revolution whenever your boss is being an absolute prick. You just have to do the best you can with what youâ€™ve got.,8

I grew up in a neighborhood close to a gypsy community in Spain. We were "attending" to the same school beside the fact that they rarely were at school after primary.\n\nI had a close friend a gypsy girl which now I realize we were kind of in love each other but she only talked to me in the classroom cause in the playground I could easily receive a rain of fist and kicks by her cousins\\* (every gypsy is a cousin of a gypsy). After primary never saw her until we were 20 She was carrying 5/6 kids and pretended not to recognize me.\n\nIf I learned something from gypsies is that they are not a minority and they don\'t feel like that. For them there are two types of people gypsies and "payos" literally not-gypsy. To their eyes you are not worthy of their respect unless you prove it.\n\nThey are racist with anyone is not gypsy. Every other racial aspect has a pejorative name I won\'t reproduce here prepended with "payo".\n\nThey reject openly any law except their own law. Thieving is acceptable as long as they don\'t theft  on gypsies.\n\nOne exception of the out lawlessness is asking for retirement plans and public helps as soon as they can apply and municipalities barely deny them to avoid troubles. \n\nThey are misogynist and homophobic any gay or liberal woman is expelled forever. Women are explicitly expelled if they marry non-gypsy males either. Not so long ago the punishment was stoning.\n\nWomen aren\'t allowed to study are publicly ashamed if they are not virgin (is mandatory a virginity test DURING the wedding).\n\nSpain is the door from Africa and South America to Europe. I lived and befriended people from there for decades and they make a huge effort to became citizens learn and adapt their live to Europe and usually they eventually became officially nationals. They deserve all my respect but those guys...\n\nOf course in the last years there have been opening movements but the hard core is still pushing for ancient laws family codes and extortion.,8

Religious institutions are constantly chased out of the public square.\n\n>You know its funny two of your biggest jumps on your chart were two things that personally made you think about death (family death and covid).\n\nVery presumptuous of you. I had no one in my family die of COVID and I certainly was not afraid of a bad flu. COVID made me realize how temporary *all* things on Earth were (not just my life) with the shutdowns and whatnot. We live in a society where the government can very easily take away whatever it wants from us. But they can\'t take away God because He is always there. If I live for God then my short life here on Earth is always full regardless of whether I am a free man or political prisoner. From that point it was an easy step to adopt Catholicism the one true church.\n\nAdditionally COVID pushed us to the Latin Mass which actually continued to operate normally unlike modern Catholic Churches. Witnessing how people used to worship was a very eye-opening experience. \n\n>but you can\'t fathom actually using your religious ideals as an excuse to actually help real kids.\n\nAgain I\'d love to see the Church have the support it needs to do this. Ideally you could "cancel out" your taxes paid to welfare programs if that money is donated to the Church instead. But given the cultural hostility to the Church that is pretty much a pipe dream save some kind of societal collapse (through which the Church will survive like it always has).,7

You\'re putting a lot of words in my mouth bucko. I see the merit of the argument for an armed populace. I just don\'t think the concept has stood the test of time. \n\nThe US is indeed Bad on a local state national and global scale there is a lot to criticize and naturally a lot to laud. I think the level of citizen access to firearms is an issue. You might have read "I think guns should be banned" but that isn\'t what I said. \n\nI asked you to back up the claim. Don\'t make me do the legwork that\'s poor argumentative form. You comment read as if you were referring to a specific set of states. But a cursory glance of dictatorships (according to the democracy index) with permessive gun (according to Uni of Sydney) laws includes:\n\n Nigeria Zambia Tanzania Senegal Pakistan Honduras Albania (<-"hybrid regimes"| authoritarian states->) Republic of Congo Yemen & Azerbaijan.\n\nSo what does that tell us? honest question.,4
"Why not try to elect someone who'll lower those prices? \nOh wait",6

That\'s why Trump has done more to encroach on the 2A than Obama did because when Obama tried it he went too big and was told to fuck off.,1

The US has 4 times the violent crime rate and 18 times the murder rate of the UK which counters your point that the UK has "their fair share of crazies". No they don\'t because they\'re all in Chicago and Detroit (and Rio de Janeiro). \n\nAnother factor that leads to this disparity is of course the fact that criminals are more armed. More guns per capita equals more guns per criminal and so it\'s safer for the police to shoot a deadly threat. The proportion of unarmed killings is virtually zero in the US and even in most of those cases the suspect behaved aggressively. \n\nLastly doctrine which is what you two are arguing about. While it makes sense for a bobby to learn how to pursue and disarm in a non-lethal way in a country where every Tom Dick and Harry has a Glock it is a better expenditure of resources to teach how to aim center-mass.,1

"We have two areas and the one that is much richer and much less impoverished has nearly 4 times higher homicide rate. So clearly you must believe that population density is by far the most important factor that determines homicide rates and it's far more important than income and poverty.\n\n\nIncreased population density does not cause higher murder rates. Any correlation seen between population density and murder rates in the U.S is due to black people living mostly in the cities. No such correlation is observed in a homogeneous country like Japan where murder rates are spread fairly uniformly across the country and Tokyo metropolitan area actually has the lowest murder rate in the country despite having by far the highest population density.  \n\nWe can also compare PG county to Irvine.\n\nPrince George's County has a population density of 2 003 people per square mile\n\nIrvine has a population density of 5 124 people per square mile.\n\nIrvine has slightly higher poverty rate but also slightly higher average income around 15% higher than PG county which certainly cannot account for the massive disparity in homicide between these two areas.\n\nIf population density mattered Irvine should have higher homicide rates because it has a much higher population density than PG county but Irvine has more than 15 times lower homicide rate than PG county and is the city with the lowest homicide rate with a population above 300k pop in the U.S.\n\nRoughly the same income roughly the same poverty rate and Irvine population density is 2.5x higher. If you were correct Irvine would have higher homicide rate not 15 times lower homicide rate.",4

Leftist to someone outside of the UK who only sees a small portion. If you ask a person living in the UK who pays attention to the news they would call it right as it has a huge Tory bias which is our right wing party. Any questionable detail a labour member (our left wing party) does gets reported like crazy and is big news. The guy running the BBC the chairman is a large Tory donor. But I guess he donates to the right and runs the biggest leftist media organisation in the world. Maybe heâ€™s the 1 right winger out of the sea of left in the BBC. Oh wait the panel of people who voted him in are also Tory donors. So the owner is a Tory donor the panel that voted him in are Tory donors but it is a leftist organisation. \n\nIf you had said unbiased I would disagree but fair enough. To call it left because it has a bit of leftist propaganda in the stuff that doesnâ€™t actually matter in real life and how people live. But when elections politicians and anything meaningful happens the bias is clearly shown. Just to clarify Im not saying propagandists they donâ€™t turn a blind eye to big fuck ups but there is a bias.\n\nEdit: Just to add I think the ones who make the big decisions are smart at the BBC. Theyâ€™ve kept the brand as an unbiased media platform by not being so over to the bias by losing a few battles were it doesnâ€™t really matter. Itâ€™s not like Fox News were everything left bad or CNN but for the right. Theyâ€™ve even convinced people that theyâ€™re left wing.\n\nAnother thing to add I thought Iâ€™d give an example. When the news broke the Tory government had given government contract to friends and we were overpaying as a country for PPE gear and other things for covid. Almost immediately after the news that the Tories held a lockdown parties during covid while we were told to be in lockdown conditions (side note: There were traces of cocaine found at the party a few other news outlets reported this not the BBC). Now guess which news story should an unbiased or even left wing media that is for the people funded by the people would have repeat coverage on. Probably the one of possible governmental fraud with public funds during an epidemic. Well I saw more coverage on PartyGate. MPs being questioned more on how could they have a party while everyone couldnâ€™t go see loved ones than the possible crime done by the ones in power.,0

That would be pretty silly at a time when the government is (wisely!) forcing nonessential businesses to shut their doors.\n\nThe goal is to provide relief to affected individuals (relief checks expanded UI) and businesses (loans) so that people can feed their families and pay rent now so that when circumstances return to normal the economy can spring back to where it was.,8

Yeah I agree. I don\'t at all mind full on tradwives staying in the kitchen if that\'s what they want. I get your initial aversion against the idea of gender being a construct because nowadays it seems to be used to shame housewives and promote women to become just as work-oriented as men. This is just capitalism corrupting things as it always does. Female empowerment today is broadly seen as a potential doubling of the work force. A tasty prospect for neoliberals. But really this shaming of housewives is just an inverted version of the old society forcing women to become housewives; it\'s forcing women to become workers to boost the economy. Neoliberal "feminism" is a joke a farce to double the work force.   \n\n\nThe emphasis should be freedom of choice and female empowerment which is what uncorrupted feminism is about. Want to work? Fine. Want to stay at home? Fine. Each couple should find the outcome that suits their wishes best as long as the wishes of the man and woman are equally valued. And for many couples this means a semi-traditional set up. Here in the Netherlands the norm for women is to work part time. Not because society tells them to but because this is the current natural end result of couples deciding how to organise their household and income. That is what they themselves want. Of course neoliberals are triggered by this and want to promote full time work as the norm but I see no issue in this. Empowerment is not working full time it\'s agency to decide for yourself what roles you take on.,0

I mean you are an example of a victim of Trump\'s populist propaganda. The statement "What institution in the U.S. actually deserved trust?" is actually hilarious. When you get off these incredibly online groups you realize how ludicrous that statement is. Institutions are made up of millions of Americans the idea there\'s this secret cabal that has somehow never been shown is the kind of thing only present in fantasy novels. This ties in with my second point. Trump tossed out so much misinformation many people became nihilistic assuming no true information could be found. True information can be found but like any good populist who needs a loyal following Trump had to tarnish the reputation of reliable sources of information so he could be the sole source of information for his followers.\n\nOne Georgia center temporarily closing is enough to shut down the nation\'s voting?

It\'s like listing the reasons Hitler is evil and starting off by saying he picks his boogers.

I hope that youâ€™re joking then again I couldnâ€™t really follow your line of thought so you couldâ€™ve been. Itâ€™s not a mystery why a young woman would want to have sex with a man sheâ€™s not attracted to: coercion physical or financial or blackmail. Human trafficking and prostitution are linked both through data ["On average countries where prostitution is legal experience larger reported human trafficking inflows."](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X12001453) and [known tactics of coercion](https://www.ncvctta.org/post/human-trafficking-an-overview-of-sex-trafficking). [We also know how women get trafficked into it from their own perspectives](https://time.com/longform/windie-jo-lazenko-sex-trafficking-survivor/). I live in San Diego and [weâ€™re one of the worst places in the US for human trafficking](https://www.sdcda.org/preventing/human-trafficking/human-trafficking-faqs) and coincidentally Iâ€™m sure prostitution. [And most of itâ€™s run by gangs](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-sex-trafficking-usd-study-prosecutions-2015oct31-htmlstory.html).

How many illegal immigrants who donâ€™t contribute in taxes do you believe receive healthcare? Itâ€™s negligible. Again youâ€™ve been scared into believing this is a legitimate financial concern when itâ€™s a complete crock of shit. On top of the fact the resource arenâ€™t as accessible and no questions asked as youâ€™re implying. I work in healthcare I know this to be a fact. Very few places would provide medical services to an illegal immigrant and absolutely nothing major so Idk what you are even talking about. \n\n3.  Donâ€™t prosecute what? Pretty vague to have its own bullet point. Donâ€™t prosecute poor as fuck families trying to cross illegally so we donâ€™t waste additional money and resources on a dire  immigration situation that is already expensive? We separate families to put parents into the criminal justice system for what reason? Send them back and be done with it. Itâ€™s more expensive to jail someone then to deport them itâ€™s also a savagely malicious thing to do to a desperate family. \n\nI legitimately donâ€™t understand what the fuck you are talking about.

">Explain to me again how bike thief / fetus are equated in this analogy?\n\nA woman was engaging in the reasonable activity of (bike ownership/sex). One day a person who she did not intend to use her (bike/body) started using it without her permission. That person was the (bike thief/fetus) and they had no right to do that. Just because the woman (owned a bike/had sex) did not mean that she consented to that specific outcome even though she knew that (bike theft/pregnancy) was a potential thing that could happen when she (bought the bike/had sex).\n\nIf society is able to we should (return the bike/allow her an abortion) so that she does not suffer consequences for something she did not consent to.\n\n> The fetus isnâ€™t there without consent itâ€™s there due to the actions of the pregnant woman and the risks she was willing to take\n\nThis isn't correct my story kinda explains it but no - the fetus does not have consent just because the woman had sex. Just like a thief doesn't have consent to use your bike just because you dared to own one in the first place. \n\nAgain just because (bike theft/pregnancy) was a potential outcome of (bike ownership/sex) does not automatically mean you consented to it.\n\n> The woman consented to the fetus when she decided to have risky sex because that is an INHERENT risk of partaking in reproductive functions.\n\nBike theft is an INHERENT risk of partaking in bike ownership.

"I agree but most of that problem is caused by them not already being out there talking to girls. If they would have started a couple/few years ago they'd be at that point already. This whole process should have been started in school years and continued into adulthood so that they're already in social groups where they're interacting with real women regularly. Once you're interacting with women on the regular it doesn't take that much time (maybe a couple of dates) to get to the point where you're getting some romantic affection from one of them. No they may not be as immediate available or sexual as the online waifus but it is real which goes so much further.\n\nIt isn't like it takes years to get from first meeting to romantic relationship or even just friendship. When I was dating it wasn't unusual in the slightest to ask a girl you recently met out on a first date.

Normally itâ€™s just a bunch of shitposts about the political compass and its different sections.

Itâ€™s a lovely place but many parts of downtown and old Mt Pleasant were homes granted through reparations. Over the years families have sold and now theyâ€™re worth millions due to location. Most of the lower class and the Gullah Geechee community have been pushed up to North Charleston and Summerville. Hell my parents are white and bought their home for $150K in a predominately black neighborhood back in 2004. Now itâ€™s worth over $400K and many of their original neighbors have all sold and moved away. Itâ€™s not uncommon when cities see a large population boom like that - but I think the ties to reparations and the cities history make it a little more tangible.,1

Right. Let me present an analogy which I think illustrates the distinction here.\n\nSay we have some type of establishment where it would normally be commonplace for customers to drink alcohol. And say we have an instance of that type of establishment which was created by Baptists. Because of this they made it a rule that there would be no alcohol because they dislike its consumption on principle.\n\nThere\'s no rule stopping non-Baptists from visiting this establishment (citizens) nor is there any rule stopping non-Baptists from being members of the staff (members of government). Yet it is observable that the business was created by Baptists because the rules reflect those values.\n\nThe people arguing that "separation of church and state" implies "the country wasn\'t founded on Judeo-Christian principles" would essentially be arguing that because this hypothetical business doesn\'t discriminate based on religion (for its customers nor its employees) it must have been created with secular principles in mind. But that isn\'t necessarily the case. It\'s possible for the business to have been created with Baptist values but still be firm on the idea that no one should be discriminated against for their religion. It\'s just that if they want to drink alcohol they\'ll have to do it somewhere else.\n\nThat might be a dumb analogy; I\'m a little tired. But it made sense to me.,8

A lot of Trumpâ€™s executive orders actually weakened the administrative state (eliminating approvals for infrastructure projects ordering agencies to cut spending etc).\n\nBiden in one executive order effectively nationalized an entire industry (student loans).\n\nThe contents of the orders are a lot more relevant than the quantity of orders.\n\nYour argument is from ignorance not fact.,1

A birth certificate should only document a birth not the existence of a person. Therefore the information on it should be that from birth time. Further certificates like a certificate of a person existing or being alive or owning property should contain information from the time the certificate was created.\n\nEg. if you were born female but are now male your birth certificate would say that and so would any certificate that was created before you changed your legal gender to male. From there on all newly created certificates would show you as either male or female depending on wether the certificate describes an event before or after changing your legal gender.\n\nA certificate of any type that describes your present status would there fore list you as the legal gender you were during printing of that certificate.,8

"When talking about preventing the sale to and ownership of guns by people convicted of the misdemeanor of domestic violence the [Gun control act of 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Control_Act_of_1968) already does this.\n\n> It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such personâ€”\n>\n> (1) is under indictment for or has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; \n\n...\n\n> (8) is subject to a court order that restrains such person from harassing stalking or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child except that this paragraph shall only apply to a court order thatâ€”\n>\n> (A) was issued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice and at which such person had the opportunity to participate; and\n>\n>(B)\n>\n>(i) includes a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child; or\n>\n>(ii) by its terms explicitly prohibits the use attempted use or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury; or\n>\n>(9) has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\n\nI mean part (1) of that is pretty wide sweeping. It cover's any  conviction (which would include assault battery etc) which results in being sentenced to a year or more in prison. And then they special case it to cover instances of domestic violence because domestic violence is a situation where things are statistically more dire.\n\nUnder Biden's proposal however anyone whose ever been in a physical altercation will be banned from possessing fire arms regardless. More specifically it's going to hit everyone whose accepted a plea deal to avoid going to court/receiving jail time which is staggering number of people.\n\n> More than 97 percent of federal criminal convictions are obtained through plea bargains and the states are not far behind at 94 percent. [nbc news](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/prisons-are-packed-because-prosecutors-are-coercing-plea-deals-yes-ncna1034201)\n\nHonestly the 1 year prison term restriction is a really low bar already for taking away a right and dropping it to the floor like this so it includes a large swath of people who were likely coerced into a guilty plea to avoid the possibility of a worse sentence would be a massive overreach.\n\nBiden has a lot on that page about enforcing currently existing laws which are on the book which I do think is a *good* thing. But when he mixes that in with stuff like this:\n\n> Hold adults accountable for giving minors access to firearms. Biden supports legislation holding adults criminally and civilly liable for directly or negligently giving a minor access to a firearm regardless of whether the minor actually gains possession of the firearm.\n\nIt's hard to believe what he's proposing is being done in good faith (seriously making it illegal to give minor's access to a firearm? Sure lets make it illegal to take kids hunting and teach them how to safely use a firearm). Because of how extreme a lot of what he's proposing is it's hard to look at even the most benign looking proposals on the list without wondering what the catch is.",8

Acknowledging that racism and bigotry exists in the U.S. is a whole lot more contentious than it should be \n\n......   ^(the general train of thought goes something like: racism = bad but I believe that treating people poorly based on their differences from me is fair and normal and right because nothing bad happens to *me* when it happens so that can\'t be racist so racism can\'t exist so they must be using racism as an excuse for things that are their fault so they must be inherently lesser than I am and it\'s perfectly fair and normal and right to treat them poorly based on their differences from me so racism = good unless it\'s suggested that it actually has consequences in which case racism = bad but me=racist=good so if me=good and racism=bad then racism can\'t *really* be a thing that people should be getting upset at us=me for and anyone=them who suggests otherwise is wrong=bad=racist)\n\n...... but most other countries just take the route of "can\'t be racist if there aren\'t any other races." \n\nWe uniquely fucked that up by becoming a republic founded by immigrants who rebelled against imperial rulers that asserts everyone who lives under us has inalienable rights and promising immeasurable wealth prosperity and opportunity; by treating an entire continent inhabited by people for thousands of years as free real estate and moving in with our imported slaves.,8

The problem here is that our overabundance of governmental influence on the economy and redundant laws offer the wealthy more possibilities to cheat the system creating a diadvantage to their competitors. \n\nThats why imo we need a very lean but strong state: few but easily applyable taxes for example. Instead of more convoluted taxes which offer even more loopholes to be abused we need something like VAT (Value-added tax) or Land-Tax. Otherwise as long as a country introduces complicated taxes this allways favor bigger corporations simply because they can afford the overhead instead of their smaller competitors.

This is actually incorrect.  Poor people tend to be white black people tend to be poor.\n\nWhile a higher percent of black people are poor compared to other races that does not mean a higher percent of the poor are black.  Whites still make up the majority of the poor and impoverished in the USA.\n\nIf it was just poor people being more likely to commit violent crimes white people would be over represented instead of underrepresented in those statistics.

The BDR had way better conditions thanks to the "Marshall plan" which the soviets couldnt do themselves because they were completely destroyed by the war. America wasnt. You can clearly See today that capitalism didnt help east germany - it only made things even worse. Korea litturaly got bombed into stone age by the US and is now so heavily embargoed that people cant build anything and still use stuff from before the 90s.\nThe USSR survived because they had a sustainable economy.

While you\'re not strictly wrong (I have seen many good movies I disagree with politically and even the odd good woke movie) I think "woke" and "bad storytelling" are closely linked.

Completely pointless side quest feels like a preachy padding of run time at best when you watch it and clearly exists solely because Rian Johnson has a woke axe to grind with the wealthy and the irony of that is almost certainly lost on him since he is so unsubtle a guy. Perhaps there *could* have been a good way to fit Canto Bight into the movie and the universe but Johnson clearly wasn\'t concerned about either of those.

Did you just link a bunch articles on mental health? Is that what I think you did?\n\nOh gee I wonder what causes mental health issues on youths of mixed races when there are people like you who call us mutts and the such. A true mystery indeed.\n\nThe other articles you linked have nothing to with individuals of mixed race themselves and are you fucking deffending inbreeding with that one on Iceland?\n\nSomething tells me you only read the title of most of those because they talk about the social aspects of being an individual of a mixed race not biological.\n\nDo you want me prove my point further?\n\nOk let\'s take a look at something that can be proven with a simple empirical observation.\n\nLet\'s take the dog example. Most pure breed dogs are a fucking crime against nature they have shorter life spans and a fuck-ton of health issues. Mutts on the other hand breed out all that crap and become resilient as fuck with higher resistences to diseases and climate.\n\nGenetics on humans works the same way it does on any other animal it\'s not simple RNG and averages that is complete and utter bullshit and you will never be able to prove otherwise because it is just plain wrong. \n\nDominant characteristics are way more likely to be passed down when you mix races while on the other hand defects related to recessive genes are way more present on individuals of "pure race" especially when there is inbreeding involved.,7

>We produce that now under what could be described as a global capitalist system.

The state is a product and a manifestation of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms. The state arises where when and insofar as class antagonism objectively cannot be reconciled. And conversely the existence of the state proves that the class antagonisms are irreconcilable. Without contending classes I.e without irreconcilable class antagonisms there is no need for a state and hence it withers away.,6

*TLDR: An obese person is very unlikely to read a pointed or aggressive criticism and change their habits because of it.* Well it was a probing question not necessarily to be used as a criticism. I assumed that it wasn\'t necessary to clarify that I don\'t literally think that people shouldn\'t care at all about the actions of others which is certainly my fault because it\'s hard to imply things such as that over the internet. This also makes use of my point though as your criticism has lead me to reconsider how I could\'ve worded my statement. Though I\'ll say that apprehensiveness can usually cause people to go on the defense and reject your point but situationally I can certainly see your point and I agree with you. As for the main point I find that in a general sense the act of self-care does not necessarily have to be productive. I used to work 24 hour shifts for example and sometimes simply lazily debriefing via TV or video games was a good way to recover psychologically. I do find that overeating or obesity as a whole is a huge detriment to the individual as well as a detriment to the community. That said I definitely think a sensitive case such as this does not exactly leave the individual receptive to comments like that. I think in general fatphobia is not very productive in our society as it causes this sort of "war" between people who hate fatness and people who defend or justify fatness. You don\'t have to be fatphobic to not want to be fat but you might be fatphobic if you\'d rather die than be fat. Everyone should strive to not be fat the same way everyone should strive to be smart strong skilled etc. It\'s not realistic for everyone to actually succeed in this endeavor. If someone believes that no-fatness is the most important endeavor to progess society I will support any good solutions they come up with.,0

They are trying to identify as a libertarian the same way some teenage girl who kissed her friend Sarah is now a bisexual; they are appropriating something that doesn\'t belong to them.\n\nI think the only thing more wrong than the right calling themselves Christians is the right calling themselves libertarians. \n\nIt\'s literally classical liberalism. Anti-authoritarianism. Civil liberties *and* civil rights. \n\nLike the meme itself the right aren\'t libertarian any more than Somalia is libertarian. The right\'s idea of a "libertarian paradise" is anarchy for outsiders fascism for the favoured. \n\nAn actual libertarian paradise consists of good government when it works small government when it doesn\'t no government when it is useless. It isn\'t about corporations and state-owned businesses it\'s about the individual. \n\nConservatives view private property as absolutes but the point of private property is that it\'s entrusted to people who respect the public good.\n\nAll things have to fall under "your right to swing your nose stops at my face" - having power and property is right *and* a responsibility. It\'s not like some bizarre system where you extract rent from people using a road for authoritarian purposes but more like a system where you raise a collection to improve the road. If you can pay you do. If you can\'t you don\'t. But if you are able to pay you should be responsible enough to pay more.\n\nIt\'s not about extracting rent it\'s about stewardship and using personal liberty to work for the collective good and the collective good helping to promote personal liberty.\n\nThe right cares nothing about the collective good. This is why they can\'t be libertarians.,0

"Not a joke I'm completely serious. I've had a couple of Asian friends and I have acquaintances of most races although my neighbourhood is very white despite my city being diverse which meant even before I became racist a few years ago I didn't interact much with blacks in social settings. Regarding why I'm racist a guy asked me the same questions a couple of weeks ago so I'll copy paste what I said to him\n\nBasically I think the variation in outcomes by race is primarily because of biological differences. Racial variance in average IQ aggression levels time preference or ability to delay gratification and many other factors are mostly due to fundemental biological divergence between races resulting from evolution and these differences are responsible for the disparate outcomes in terms of success of different groups of people. We can see these differences on the national scale where some groups like east asians are highly successful wealthy and not criminal whereas other groups like blacks are impoverished overrepresented in criminal statistics and do poorly in education. We can also look at the international scale where white or asian run countries are doing very well generally safe prosperous and stable whereas african countries are the opposite. If you want one of the sources I found most convincing regarding race-iq being biological I'll link it below but be warned it's a long read and not super interesting unless you are into race science. Also look at the Minnesota transracial adoption study which shatters any claim of the black-white iq gap being due to environmental factors.\n\nAlso I think inherent in diversity is conflict and as such I'm strongly against the diversification of the west over the last few decades. I want a stable orderly and polite society and I don't think that is possible when you cram ethnic groups with vastly different interests beliefs and values and try to govern them under one state. I'm a proponent for the concept of nation states which we took for a given up until very recently. Essentially each nation (a group with common culture heritage history and ancestry) should have its own state where the people govern themselves and pursue their own interests. Germans in Germany Nigerians in Nigeria Japanese in Japan and Swedish in Sweden. In terms of the USA I think it should balkanize into two countries one for blacks and one for whites because we absolutely cannot get along.\n\nwww1.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/30years/Rushton-Jensen30years.pdf",5

With the names they called Kanye or the black democrat politician that just said something good about trump. \n\n\nOf course they are gonna get pissed when the people they rely on to keep them in power see an angle that isn't the one they want with all they spent to engrain it in their mind",4

>being able to do whatever you want just because youâ€™re a woman; itâ€™s about wanting to be treated equally. \n\nThis is my point youâ€™re treated equally! you think men get special treatment? If a guy walks naked on the street or post pics in underpants you will not instantly consider this as sexual? you may like it or not but you will see the sexual sens of the picture or the act. Considering that women can literally post naked pictures and think men will react rationally is stupid. Are you sure you want true equality? Or just equality when itâ€™s convenient? \n\n>The third wave feministic bullshit is thinly veiled misandry under the guise of women empowerment.\n\nAgree and I donâ€™t remember first and second waves feminist being in favor or stuff like Onlyfans and hyper sexualisation of girls. \n\n>Do I agree that the guy was harassing her by staring? Depends on how often and how intensely. Do I think she should have worn more than a sports bra/crop top to avoid situations like this? Absolutely\n\nThis was exactly my point I didnâ€™t said anything over this you bring rape and harassment \n\n>but what someone is wearing isnâ€™t justification for bad behavior by others.\n\nNever said otherwise but you always keep a part of the responsibility for you even if itâ€™s a tiny % of responsibility. We should teach people to be more careful not less careful right?,7

Like in what context do teachers need to discuss sexuality with 8 year olds?\n\n>if that bill did not want to be the "dont say gay" bill it should have carveouts specifically to exclude basic explanations of what sexual orientation is. and it simply does not have those. it actually avoids using the term "sexually explicit" or anything of the sort and uses "sexually oriented". if all it cared about was not showing porn to kids it would have used sexually explicit.\n\nWhy would we even care to discuss any of that with 8 year olds? Do you not see the issue that some far too large percentage of the population wants 8 year olds to know what anal sex is?\n\n>this post also does not change the fact that the bill it mentions quite literally bans talking about priviledge that an individual can obtain by being part of a specific sex race ethnicity or color.\n\nGood. I went through all my schooling up until law school without discussing privilege and topics that broach on critical race theory. Nothing of value was gained. I learned about slavery Jim Crow redlining the Civil rights movement. All that is taught because that\'s history. Teaching a 7 year old that he\'s privileged because he\'s of European descent even though he lives in a trailer for example doesn\'t seem to be helpful for fostering healthy students.,1

"I'm unsure where the emphasis on reproduction comes from when speaking about mental health. Mental health isn't related to ensuring healthy demographics for society but more to personal mental stability and happiness. Simply loving someone different doesn't at all qualify as a mental illness in my view.\n\nIf like 50% of the population is gay and the majority of them opt to not have children then sure we have a demographic disaster on our hands. But that is linked to an overall healthy society not to whether those individuals are healthy. So sure society's health requires that LGBT stay a minority since whether we like it or not the traditional family unit is the core of society. LGBT can contribute as family units themselves by adopting or getting IVF children but that doesn't take away they have less of an impulse to want children. Compared to heterosexual couples for whom it's generally a no-brainer to form a family gay couples are much less likely to do this. Any birth rate that is outside the range of steady decline replacement rate or steady growth of population is damaging to society. Just look at what the lasting effects of boomers are still 60 years after their conception.\n\nBut since LGBT are by far not numerous enough to cause a significant tanking of the birth rate then why not fully accept them? And remember that even if they would be numerous enough stimulating them to get more children could normalise the birth rate too even though I'm sceptical of whether people who are less predisposed to wanting children can be stimulated enough to get this done.\n\nI see no reason to believe that LGB and post-transition T should be considered mentally ill.",0

Correct and I never said I was against that. Just that I\'m against highschoolers thinking they live/have seen the real world and not paying attention in high school economics. \n\nOn the subject of pure politics; I am 100% on board with a financial "safety net"  for those below the poverty line; and would honestly rather have universal healthcare rather than our current broken bloated system. as I work in the medical field I deal with billing and it is an absolute nightmare to be honest. Each insurance is billed a different amount and pays a different amount and it is just a mess. Insurances have the pull of all their customers behind them so we have to haggle extremely low with them; so we jack prices up for everyone so that "low" becomes what was normal; which screws over anyone with shitty/no insurance.\n\nBasically: medicine is broken as fuck and I would rather fix the current system; but at this point it\'s so broken that UH would be better easier to implement and more popular and therefore easier to get enacted.,8

She was a communist active in both the SDP and the Spartacists has contributed quite a few writings organized the first International Women's Day. Fled to the USSR after the Nazis came to power lived in Moscow as a personal guest of Stalin until dying of old age in 1933.\n* Assata Shakur for authleft. A Maoist and Panther who later became a leading member of the Black Liberation Army and engaged in armed resistance against the united states as well as extrajudicial killings of drug dealers. Was at the top of the most wanted list for a while. She was eventually caught but escaped and found political asylum in Cuba where she still lives today. She's also Tupac's aunt.\n* Sophie Scholl for libleft. She was a German socialist who tried to organize a pacifist resistance against Hitler with ties to a lot of other resistance members. The Nazis caught her and sentenced her to death by guillotine and she became a martyr to resistance groups all over Europe. Her writings on pacifism were later airdropped everywhere in Germany by the allies. There's a decent movie about her *the Final Days*.\n* Simone de Beauvoir for libleft. Arguably the founder of second-wave feminism the person to spark an interest in looking at the social rather than the legal relations between men and women. Also an influential libertarian socialist and anti-Soviet Marxist as well as a founding existentialist philosopher.\n* Ursula Le Guin for libleft. Famous author of fiction with anarchist themes also famous author of anarchist non-fiction. One of the greatest American writers ever cited as a literary influence by many modern writers. She also singlehandedly collected and digitized a *lot* of old anarchist writings and the modern revival of the anarchist tradition after the decline of anarchism between Catalonia and the 60s is partially due to her.",0

I donâ€™t believe obesity is a consequence of poverty but it *is* correlated. 100% (even after years of searching Iâ€™ve never actually found a human body that breaks the laws of conservation of energy) of obesity cases can be resolved by exercising willpower and putting the fork down but poverty goes hand in hand with exhaustion and depression and those conditions can make it very hard to exercise willpower. \n\nI would simply provide a financial and societal incentive for healthy habits. Plenty of room for discussion on what those incentives should be like subsidized vegetables and tax credits for fitness. You donâ€™t demolish a building with one giant explosion you use dozens of smaller explosions to produce an outsized effect with little wasted energy. The same principle applies to governance. \n\nHumans respond to incentives em masse. If you create a proper system of incentives most of the problems solve themselves and the administration naturally gets reduced to the handling of relatively rare edge cases and outliers. Thatâ€™s where the disincentives come in.,6

"Lord Mahavir himself Said that there are a 1000 Beings in every drop of water every breath of air. There is life in trees rocks plants and beneath the surface of this Earth  It's all included in our holy texts Mahavir Puran. We do not believe in Creationism. Earth was as is it Thirthankars Came are spread the knowledge of life around to everyone. \n\nIn total we have 24 Tirthankars who are the primary gods that we worship. A puran is a text that has the teachings and life story of each tirthankar. Out of the 24 Purans the history of India is such that Islamic Invaders and Christian Missionaries pillaged and destroyed hundreds of Jain temples and out of 24 6 were lost to history forever as entire Communities were massacred and libraries burnt down. Think of how much knowledge was lost. We were always a very small minority and don't believe in converting other people. \n\nUnfortunately Jainism was never given much importance in Media and Culture globally as we are indeed just 0.4% of the population in India. We do have a shit Ton of money but unlike the Jews we do not have mass influence over society.

I donâ€™t get what youâ€™re saying? My initial comment was a joke at SJWâ€™s expense. The AHS style people who unironically believe â€œ9 normal people and 1 Nazi means there are 10 Nazis.â€\n\nThatâ€™s the fallacy I was pointing it. Just because I think Nazis should be allowed to say what they want doesnâ€™t mean I agree with what they have to say. \n\nHence supporting a fascistâ€™s right to free speech doesnâ€™t make me a fascist. In fact it makes me the opposite of a fascist because fascism is all about limited personal freedom in favour of state control. \n\nIâ€™m not attributing anything to OP either. \n\nAnd people who use â€œFree speechâ€ as a defence are  often doing just that defending their free speech. If you argument against me using slurs is â€œYou canâ€™t say that itâ€™s hate speech!â€ My response of â€œfree speechâ€ is valid.\n\nA more pertinent point to make would be to question my use of slurs specifically. Instead of saying â€œyou canâ€™t say that â€ ask me why Iâ€™m saying it. Where my apparent hatred comes from for example.\n\nAnd personally I think slurs shouldnâ€™t be banned because words can be reclaimed. Just as gay people have reclaimed queer so too can any offensive term. Banning a word or making it taboo simply gives hateful people more power.\n\nIf someone calls a gay person a â€œf*ggotâ€ and the gay person reacts then the bigot has power over them. If the gay person (and society as a whole) treat f*ggot like another word (Iâ€™m only censoring so the sub doesnâ€™t get banned) then the bigot has less power. \n\nHatefulness should stem from intent. Iâ€™m not saying let people use slurs hatefully without interference. Obviously challenge hateful people and educate them. But do so as peacefully and politely as possible. Ignorance is the root of hatred and it is treated with education. \n\nI support free speech because I genuinely believe it is better for people to be able to say things not because I want to call people bad things without consequences.\n\nEspecially since the latter isnâ€™t free speech either. Free speech is being able to say anything without governmental interference so long as it doesnâ€™t incite violence. It serves a purpose of maintaining free press and avoiding tyranny (another excellent reason to keep it around.)\n\nBut anyway. If I call someone a f*ggot and they proceed to insult me they are within their rights to do so. Social consequences for speech are valid but not governmental responses. Also if you turn violent against someone for their words youâ€™re in the wrong no matter how atrocious the words they say are.,4

To be fair the Nordic countries (especially Sweden) could do a lot better in terms of tax policy. A huge contributor to the current decay of public institutions in Sweden is the fact that middle-income tax burden is very high while the tax burden on anyone primarily making money through capital gains is relatively low.\n\nAs a result costs are being cut everywhere because raising taxes is politically unviable (since even if it is promised that tax increases will only hit the rich nobody trusts a politician to keep that promise) and the political debate keeps revolving around finding the "one weird trick" to fix schools healthcare etc without actually spending money.,6

> It still does cost something to them directly if they pay taxes though this isnâ€™t being taken to a logical extreme. \n\nI mean that is true but oversimplified. \n\nTaxes aren\'t proportional to what you receive in return for everyone so some might get more or less benefit from the taxes they pay in depending on various factors. So you could still argue that for some part of what they get is definitely "free" in practice.\n\nAs far as healthcare goes our current system in the USA has massive administrative overhead brought on the by insurance industry that drives up prices. So while obviously having universal healthcare would not be "free " it would be more affordable in theory than current healthcare for many people. So if somebody received more healthcare for less in taxes due to this that increase in healthcare could be considered "free" as well.\n\nThis reduction in costs could come by cutting down on administrative burdens and overhead that make our healthcare in the USA absurdly expensive per-capita. It could also be done by shifting some of the burden for paying for the healthcare of the poor or desperate to the absurdly wealthy as the rich aren\'t liable to actually die or live poor lives due to not being able to afford decent healthcare.\n\nI see your point in any case. It is true that we should keep in mind that everything has a cost and calling something "free" might give people the wrong idea about something. But it\'s also true that people usually say something like "free healthcare" mostly in casual conversation and casual conversation I think should be allowed some leeway.,6

This includes the ability to make key decisions enforce restrictions on freedoms and practically everything related to contracts or property ownership. The flip side of that proxy responsibility is that parents need all avaliable information on their child since without it they can't make informed consent on the childs behalf. The legal remedy for that relationship becoming untennable is emancipation not granting the State (through schools) the right to override parental rights without process.",4

Too far left = ignorance.

Also the most we\'re allowed to inquire about the service animal is what service it is specifically trained to do.\n\nI think there was also some legal boilerplate on not discriminating on age ethnicity gender national origin sexuality or anything else that isn\'t academic performance.\n\nThis was at a really liberal place too. There wasn\'t much political discussion in my STEM field of study. But what little discussion there was leads me to conclude that only about 10% of my fellow grad students voted Trump (and 45% Clinton 5% third party and 40% non-voting because the school needed to bring in that many foreign grad students to teach low-level gen-ed STEM courses). While the actual professorship was more domestically sourced the fewer anecdotes I have of hinting at their political leanings tells me that their political views were similar.\n\nI\'d expect that if my alma matter has any sort of "deplatforming conservatives" then it\'s gonna be because there\'s such a small pool of conservatives who would be interested at speaking there so choosing the best one (of â€¦ one if they scrape the bottom of the barrel) might result in a ra[c/p]ist whose presence would create a physically unsafe environment for the students.

"You can't just ignore market forces. Canadian policies (as well as those in the USA) have produced markets that are so regulated it's not worth the effort to enter medicine at all. That's why there's a severe nursing shortage that's only going to get worse and a shortage of doctors.\n\nThat leads to massive wait times and increased costs.\n\nSmart policy involves things such as ensuring emergency care for everyone by reimbursing doctors when necessary. Dumb policy involves government control of the entire system (or close to it) either through direct nationalization severe regulation stifling of competition or whatever.\n\nHealthcare was much less expensive 20 years ago even adjusting for the most pessimistic inflation numbers such as those from shadowstats. The more we regulate healthcare the worse it gets the more expensive it gets and the fewer people want to enter.\n\nSurely there is a middle ground where we can help those truly in need without socializing the entire system.\n\nWant a simple example? Patent laws are great because they reward people for innovation by protecting their intellectual property. Without them there is almost no reason whatsoever to innovate. The flip side is that insulin has been regulated into oblivion because of a technicality that allowed a company to just snatch up the patent. Even if that wasn't the case there's no way you or I could start producing home-made insulin even if we had the knowledge. It's not that hard to produce if you can produce it and meet all the national standards for purity cleanliness etc then why shouldn't you be able to? More producers = more competition = better products at lower prices.\n\nAnother example that is a bit tangential is benzodiazepines and opiates. I'd still argue they should be legalized for moral reasons but they are so widely used and produced that their is fierce competition. A bottle of percocet (if you can get a prescription) is about $20 give or take quantity. Compare that to the highly restricted black market with all the ancillary costs necessary to get around the regulations and you can sell that bottle for $500-$1000 easily.\n\nIt makes sense to have some regulations but holy shit we have gone way past that point and we're still going.",1

I think it is somewhat about the religion though.\n\nTrue people can twist religion in whatever way they want and modify it based on culture. That is how the same Christian values have brought us witch hunts crusades inquisitions theocratic rule yet also have brought us ideas of charity and kindness to your fellow man. By cherry-picking religious texts based on cultural convenience.\n\nThough if a particular religion has nothing within it that even "can" be interpreted negatively it is more difficult to appropriate it towards a negative end. I haven\'t seen large examples of Buddhism being used to justify large-scale oppression for example though I am sure it has its own issues if you dig into its history enough.\n\nYour point though stands. People tend to do whatever they can to fit into their culture and religion tends to just be casual for most. So people will happily discard their religious beliefs or twist them if the laws or culture of their society changes at least for the most part. Or change them as politicians demand.\n\nChristians in the USA do this all the time by trying to justify how it\'s somehow Christian to be super-rich when the bible is extremely clear on the subject. Or by hating homosexuals because God has some words to say on that in the old testament all the while ignoring all of the other things said in the old testament. Like the fact that you cannot work on the sabbath or wear mixed fabrics and that people should be stoned to death for certain things etc.,6
>I mean "surface transmission" which was always and I mean always misinformation.\n\nIf by misinformation you mean contrary to established truth then yes I agree. But we did not *always* know that the disease was mostly spread through the air. Initial research showed the longevity of the virus on surfaces which is why they told everyone to douche everything down.\n\nNew information came out guidance changed. I don\'t remember the last time I was told to make wiping down surfaces a priority but it was a *long* time ago. Like before masks became a thing at all.\n\n>Turning to masks it hasn\'t mattered since May of 2021. When vaccines were widely available to anyone with the good sense to protect themselves the game was over.\n\nThat much I agree with. I don\'t think the government should have kept mask mandates for very much longer after the vaccine was widely available. I guess they still wanted to make sure hospitals didn\'t become overwhelmed but still.\n\n>Appeal to patriotism religion and individuality.\n\nI have no idea what this is even supposed to mean. Can you give an example? I feel like saying "true patriots get vaccinated" isn\'t going to be very successful among the hesitant?\n\n>The biggest problem in public health is that there are no conservatives to sit folks down and say "I don\'t think you\'ve thought this through. Here\'s a better way of reaching people."\n\nWe had a conservative **president ** what more would you have needed?\n\n>I\'m saying they didn\'t this time because they would have appealed to "Operation Warp Speed" as well as "Black Lives Matter" as ways to reach folks who were reticent and....let\'s never forget Tuskegee.\n\nAgain I\'m not sure of your point. After Tuskegee minorities are indeed extremely vaccine hesitant. BLM has as far as I am aware always been pro-vax. People just don\'t listen,8

WHY are some cities not bikeable? Thatâ€™s the question you need to ask yourself before coming to any conclusion. Cities have been demolished and rebuilt for car usage. Since biking was made extremely dangerous people by and large stopped using bikes as a means of actual transportation. Walking as well.\n\nMany destinations of car traffic are perfectly bikeable or walkable. If you go out into a suburb in the middle of nowhere itâ€™s your fault for living somewhere that is entirely dependent on cars but if you live in evenly a mildly populated area encourage changes to bring businesses towards your community instead of more car-dependent roads leading to the businesses.,0

I\'m from Portugal.\n\nThe thing about taxes is that you don\'t see where your money goes. You never make that mental connection.\n\nYou never think "here comes that ridiculous private health insurance bill"; "here comes the ridiculous private transportation infrastructure bill"; "here comes the ridiculous private police/firemen/emergency people/etc. bill"; "here comes the ridiculous private libraries/education system and internet infrastructure bill"; and most of all "here comes the ridiculous private let\'s do all the work that keeps people from revolting and torching everything and causing the society to collapse bill".\n\nWe tend to always underestimate how much it costs to run and maintain a functioning society. Even capitalism an economic system that we usually think as antagonistic to government relies entirely on the public sphere to exist. If every public official/worker suddenly stopped working it would mean the end for every business. Instant looting. No courts to recover debt. No banking regulation. Uncontrollable fires plagues etc. And that\'s what would happen immediately. But a lot of public services are about the future like obviously education or environmental services.\n\nThere\'s a weird misconception that "entrepreneurs" or "job creators" wealth is constantly stolen by the community (in the form of taxes) while in reality such wealth is only possible because the community became organized economically and socially in an extremely complex and interdependent way that relies entirely on the existence of a state that is able to keep it all working.\n\nAnd that\'s why the nordic countries pay a lot in taxes but are arguably the people living better in the world. (you can also go the Dutch route and entice companies with extremely low taxes but that obviously only works if there is only one or two tax heavens - if every country starts doing it then the competition will essentially lower taxes to zero),0

I think people over estimate the efficiency of internal combustion engines. \n\nCombustion inefficiency is caused by heat lost through the cylinder walls. This means that the ratio of the volume of the cylinder to the surface area of the cylinder is really important. Volume basically determines how much fuel is burning. So if you you a lot of fuel for a little surface area then you have an efficient engine. \n\nThis ratio is strongly affected by the â€œsquare cube lawâ€. Basically volume is m^3 and area is m^2 so as you increase your volume surface area increases less. \n\nThe square cube law and this heat conduction problem tell us that the most efficient engines are going to be those with larger combustion chambers. \n\nIn an internal combustion engine of a car the volume of the cylinder is much much lower than the volume of a power plant. This makes the power plant wayyyy more efficient at burning fuel. \n\nEven after accounting for transmission losses and losses for converting from heat to steam to electricity to kinetic energy you still usually come out on top. \n\nIn the end most internal combustion engines are only about 20% efficient whereas electric vehicles fuel to wheels are about 40% efficient. \n\nSo even burning coal if your concern is carbon emissions (and you ignore manufacturing emissions which is like the biggest caveat ever) then an electric car will be more efficient.,7

There\'s no fiction in what I say and I survived growing up in the sphere of communist influence so I probably know a lot more about the topic than you. I think I guess right based on your attitude if you have been seduced by their propaganda as a young adult or as a teen which no doubt is lucrative by promising riches from nothing at an age you haven\'t built your own wealth yet. Their reality is just deeply authoritarian and excluding from propaganda what to do with whoever disagrees with them.\n\nIn reality it\'s practically always solved by killing or imprisoning enough people to oppress the survivors to stay silent and passivated. In modern implementations such as by the Red Khmers in Cambodia it\'s about just going for the shortcut of killing anyone who has a clue or education and then some.\n\nI see you just abort a the discussion at the same stage where in practical implementation of your ideology a death squad would be sent to "solve the issue".,1

If they cared about muh separatist regions they would have cooperated with Ukrainian government to bring peace instead of unilaterally supplying the most radical representatives of one of the sides with weapons troops and commanders.\n\nOr they could have created an immigration program and helped people in Donbas with relocation to Russia. Not only would it have been orders of magnitude cheaper than the invasion it would also be good for Russiaâ€™s economy and maybe even international image.\n\nOr they could have cooperated with international community on a proposal that **Ukraine has been asking to implement for years** and allowed UN troops to take control over these territories establish an autonomous zone like in Kosovo and conduct actual non made-up referendums in 5 years to decide whether they want to separate from Ukraine. If they wanted to be with Russia so much they surely would still vote to split away from Ukraine without being held at some warlordâ€™s gunpoint wouldnâ€™t they?\n\nOr they could have just done nothing at all because the Minsk agreements were in fact working fine and last yearâ€™s civilian casualty toll in Donbas was like â€œ15 people who accidentally stepped on some 9 year old landminesâ€. And now itâ€™s thousands of people many of whom are ethnically and culturally Russian. But somehow when they live in Mariupol instead of Donetsk suddenly no one cares anymore.

Also adding that according to [this multi-year study ](https://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-multi-year-fatality-report-2005-2017.php) there are a lot of additional factors that influence whether or not a dog bites. Most of the attacks are committed by unaltered (aka non-neutered male dogs which studies show are [harder to train than non-neutered dogs ](https://www.americanveterinarian.com/news/social-behavior-differences-in-neutered-and-intact-male-dogs) and [some studies like Borcheltâ€™s suggest that aggression is more common in intact males](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304376283901116?via%3Dihub) ) and a lot of the attacks are committed by multiple dogs at once. Also worth noting is that only 9% of attacks in that 13 year period were committed by dogs that were restrained or chained up which to me hints that bad ownership practices (not neutering your pets and letting them run around off leash) definitely contributes to the prevalence of attacks.,0

Our social hierarchy was built around immigration and later urbanization. In the south slavery was built around race and the post civil war South was a continuation of most of those previous systems because reconstruction was handled terribly. But with the exception of that (and you could argue for its inclusion saying that the slaves were technically immigrated in a certain way under a certain legal grouping (a slave) and that determined their social place) American social hierarchy was built around: when you came here where you went when you got here (stayed in the city \\[Irish >:( \\] or went west \\[German :D \\]) and how much money you have.,4

Transgenderism is all over the media as well as in schools teachers that belong to this community as well as allies are pushing this narrative onto children in a few ways: teaching them about the movement making them create their own pride flags and encouraging them to consider if they are trans as it is â€œspecial.â€ These are very young and impressionable children that canâ€™t even spell the name of the cereal they had eaten that morning let alone consider their sexuality. If heterosexual pride existed and we forced elementary school children to discuss the subject and create the flags would you not take issue with it? I certainly would.\n\nOne of the main issues with the drag events involving children is that there is no condemnation of the ones where sex and nudity are presented in front of very small children - the individuals who generally support these events are not speaking out about the atrocities that occur which leads us to believe that they are either turning a blind eye denying their existence regardless of evidence or supporting them entirely. \n\nScience is not static and is constantly changing you are exactly right. I genuinely donâ€™t give a shit what people want to dress or what they want to be called it has no bearing on my life but to then have current activists and scientists screeching that there are no biological differences between the two sexes or that one can biologically transition into the other sex or that it is possible to be sexually fluid/have no sex is incorrect and a slap in the face to science which they claim to fully support.,7

Hahaha. I didn\'t know if i was talking to a theist or atheist at first this changes it. Of course i know all of that. And the fact that you\'re proposing these different things to me as huge revelations tells me you think you know a lot more than you do.\n\n"  The Old Testament was not written by single author but rather examination of the writing styles combined with historical context tells us it was likely a number of various authors over a period of  perhaps hundreds of years " Yeah no duh. The torah is the writing of moses the psalms were written by David Maccabees was written by  John Hyrcanus and so on and so forth. and it was DEFINITELY over hundreds of years. yes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n" . Remember it didn\'t use to be a single book until some hundred or so years after Jesus " Yeah I know the Catholic church is the church that put it together and decided what was and was not sacred scripture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"  The New Testament was probably written by a bunch of fishermen one actual academic scholar and a doctor among others. " YEAH I know. that\'s who the apostles were. The most scholarly among them was Judas and in case you didn\'t know he wasn\'t great he didn\'t write any of the bible though. Better than that though Paul originally Saul was originally a madman who tried to murder the other apostles AND he wrote more of the new testament than any of the others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n"  there are passages that are almost copy and pastes of earlier passages with slightly different wording " I\'m well aware of this too which makes sense especially for the new testament for 2 reasons: 1.) It was a few different peoples retelling of the same events. 2.) Much of what Jesus says are quotes of the old testament because he is the fulfillment of it.\n\nBasically your whole post was trying to discredit my faith by things that are well known throughout the faithful of my church.\n\nAnd as far as evidence I could point you to books like "The Case For Christ" or "Bible Believers Archeology" But I haven\'t read any of those kind of books so I can\'t vouch for them,3

He has made it my duty to \'stem the flood of lies\' about Cambodia\n \n.\n> it was still all America\'s fault(in true Chomsky fashion)\n\nThis is the logic of fanatical nationalists: any criticism of our home country is un-American and so Chomsky obviously just hates America.

Prior to 1865 lynchings of innocent people weren\'t nearly as common slaves were usually lashed although sometimes they were killed if it was considered to be a very serious offense either towards the community or towards their master slaves did not have a right to trial by jury since they were viewed as property not people.\n\nThe lynchings of usually innocent people ramped up a lot during the reconstruction era as a form of intimidation towards blacks and even whites who were considered to be "carpetbaggers" or "scallywags".\n\nFrederick Douglass makes reference to these crimes which many blacks were often accused of (rape) in his "Lessons of the Hour" speech and how the vast majority of these accusations were bull:\n\n>But I come to a stronger position. I rest my conclusion not merely upon general principles but upon well known facts.\nI reject the charge brought against the negro as a class because all through the late war while the slave masters of the South were absent from their homes in the field of rebellion with bullets in their pockets treason in their hearts broad blades in their blood stained hands seeking the life of the nation with the vile purpose of perpetuating the enslavement of the negro their wives their daughters their sisters and their mothers were left in the absolute custody of these same negroes and during all those long four years of terrible conflict when the negro had every opportunity to commit the abominable crime now alleged against him there was never a single instance of such crime reported or charged against him. He was never accused of assault insult or an attempt to commit an assault upon any white woman in the whole South. fact like this although negative speaks volumes and ought to have some weight with the American people.,2

"You are correct that more needs to be done the reason that alone wouldn't work is that corporate lobbying is not the only way corporate/capitalist/private power commands the state. The state (at least the liberal state model extant in western capitalist countries) does not act as an independent locus of power there is no strata of society it is inherently accountable to. As a result it will tend to be dominated by whichever institutions are most overall powerful within society by its nature. Whether this is done with lobbying media control ability to organize and mobilize voters ability to enact repression against threats or what have you liberal democracy is not an independent locus of social power. Therefore since the only truly powerful non-state institutions in most western capitalist countries are private and profit-driven they will dominate the state. The solution is to build institutions accountable to the population at large genuinely capable of contesting those private interests for control of paramount power but this is a far more difficult task than simply taking away one of capital's many tools of influence and securing one of many possible pro-social reforms",2

This is another example of why voting Democrat isn't good. Participating in this bullshit has blinded you. Frankly it's irresponsible to have people working and yet I can literally just go have brunch at a restaurant despite the pandemic being worse than ever. My state is heavily Democrat. Why? Even Democrats are slaves to business. They refuse to just fucking pay people and pay businesses to close. Other countries had successful lockdowns because they offered actual support for people. Democrats are making this about personal responsibility. If people just wore masks. I'm sorry but that's retarded. I can wear my mask to the restaurant then start spitting everywhere once I sit down? It's all a charade.\n\n\nIf you are setting your political position to the lesser of 2 evils as one side gets worse so does the other. By refusing to offer an actual view for how to improve the material conditions of people Democrats have made everything only a culture war. Economics frankly aren't on the ballot anymore. When you make people only vote based on culture then we are going to get tribalism. We are going to get Trump. FDR and the New Deal wasn't a metropolitan liberal thing the stronghold was the south. People can vote for good options if you provide them but voting Democrat actively prevents such a thing from forming. \n\nPeople need to own their vote. I am simply never going to vote for a bad candidate. If both are bad then I'll vote for nether. Biden is better than Trump vote Biden! Next election (someone indistinguishable from Trump but a Democrat) is better than Tucker Carlson vote that person! Tucker Carlson is better than Mussolini vote Tucker!

I heavily doubted it had anything to do with imitating southeners because there\'s nothing about that that would incite your typical right wing edgelord to "cringe" at it so the other explanation was them cringing at people who imitate black ways of speaking because they associate it with wokeness and SJWs and all that jazz they can\'t stop circlejerking about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that this is out of the way and explained can you like chill with the cunty twitter-esque replies a bit mate?

Yeah same. Before I did my own research I was quite liberal and left-leaning. I just pretty much "ate" the information I was fed by the large media outlets thinking I was "educated" and "knowledgable". All I was was brainwashed. I didn\'t wonder about how it could be that those who cried out that they were the oppressed and minority could at the same time have their rainbow flags waving at every powerful instituition major building and large corporation each of them virtue-signalling their NPC-thought compliance of woke political correctness to one another.But after years of doing my own research learning every day and seeing the world for what it really is I just can\'t take the blue pill anymore. I just can\'t sit idly by and close my eyes while the greatest dystopia that humanity has ever seen is being created in front of our eyes. The grey masses of NPC\'s literally thank the governments for slowly nudging them into believing things like a "social credit score system might not be so bad" and that "we have to live in a pod" "eating literal bugs for protein" "it\'s to save the planet". All while the largest of corporations will still ship plastic goods and trash from everywhere to everywhere and everyone consumes like there is no tomorrow. We are so far removed from nature as a society that there is no other way than to reject it. There was just no way any sane or at least mildly intelligent person could hold these lost positions. Hence why I am no longer libleft. Humanity has too much potential on every level from the individual to society as a whole to waste it on being a literal NPC. Hence why I emancipated myself from NPCdom.,3

Most software developers indeed don't really *need* to know the vast majority of what's taught in compsci courses.

The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid and an invitation to the White House to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in order to influence Ukraine to announce an investigation into Trump\'s political opponent Joe Biden and to promote a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine not Russia was behind interference in the 2016 presidential election. A phone call between Trump and Zelensky on July 25 2019 was particularly importantâ€”whistleblower Alexander Vindman was a participant in the call and later informed Congress."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump)\n\nAs you can see it\'s clearly stating they he solicited foreign interference in advance of the 2020 election.\n\nAlso again there was no resulting violence from these accusations so they aren\'t really comparable.,0

"That's why I left the left.  \nIt seems to be deeply ingrained within it's ranks. Heck even the books they will read is about that. Grab any marx book man is only changing the meaning of words to win a argument by having the other one not arguing about the thing itself because he isn't using the words the other one uses.   \n\n\nAdd that to the elitism the left has and then you have them mock anything you say unless you use their language and manners of speaking. In fact when you start reading their stuff they belittle you if they see you not knowing everything from day one. Feels more like a cult than anything tbh. \n\nOf course this is not only something that only the left has (if you see the jordan peterson and slavjov zyzek debate you will see how neither is actually debating the other but doing two debates that had nothing to do with what the other says.

"Yeah I guess that kind of stuff sucks when you believe the right wing strawmen about what they are.\n\n>It teaches that America was founded upon racism in the 1600s which is verifiably not true.\n\nIt wasn't founded with the express goal of further racism if that's what you mean...but the colonial project in the Americas was inherently racist. The belief in the lesser humanity of indigenous people was foundational to the society of the people who conquered them as was the belief in the lesser humanity of the enslaved Africans they imported. Racism was born as a social belief system and set of laws in order to justify and maintain order within European colonies.\n\n>It also teaches the racism is what holds back minorities from financial equivalence to whites. If that were true then immigrants and Asians would not eclipse the ethnic white population in terms of financial prosperity.\n\nThat is not what it teaches. See this is where the difference between leftists and liberals comes into play. Liberals refuse to scrutinize capitalism so the only excuses for continued economic disparity between racial groups that they can tolerate are discrimination or inherent fault. More conservative liberals are happy to blame black people etc. for their own circumstances believing them to be genetically or culturally inferior while more progressive liberals prefer to say that bigoted people are responsible for everything.\n\nA leftist understanding of the issue--actual CRT--simply points out how the material conditions created by generations of official systemic racism have left an imprint on ostensibly race-blind legal systems.  These same critiques can be applied to the capitalist system generally--those with power in previous generations passed that power down to successors without the power dynamics between owners and workers every changing--so those critiques must be obfuscated in the mainstream media.\n\nIt's simply not true that immigrants and Asians surpass the white population in terms of financial prosperity; *some* groups of Asians and immigrants surpass *some* segments of the white population. These differences are largely explained by the relative wealth and education of the various groups involved. Asian populations that came here as refugees from poor Asian countries tend to do much worse financially than those groups where the original immigrants tended to be better-educated or more prosperous than the average population in their home countries. And none of those groups compare to the wealth and power of the tiny elite population of white people who disproportionately fill the ranks of leadership in large corporations banks and politics. And when you compare that to the experience of the descendants of enslaved people and those who endured an officially apartheid society it all breaks down. \n\n>Transgenderism wants to teach that gender and sex are entirely socially constructed\n\nNope. You seem to understand that sex and gender are different things since you distinguish them by name...but then you go on to act like they're one in the same.\n\n>which is just not true as men and women not only have verifiably physical differences but neurological differences as well. Men and women will always be drawn to different subjects and different avenues of life due to chemical differences and differences in each gendersâ€™ gray matter. Trying to put so much focus on how the idea of gender is inherently oppressive ironically enough forces us to focus on gender more than it really matters.\n\nYeah and not all people fit neatly within those neurological tendencies; transgender people specifically.\n\nSocietally enforced gender roles are inherently oppressive--it's telling people that they're not allowed to act a certain way. Acknowledging that and wanting to not enforce those restrictions doesn't require us to focus on gender more than it really matters--the backlash against those efforts does that.",6

A bet that you lost and now try to ignore.\n\nAlso yes I have ADHD which would actually more apply to games that tell their story conventionally so it's not really a good argument after all a game that just throws in small bits of lore here and there requires less concentration.\n\nAlso and that seems to be very important to clarify because you still do not seem to understand is I do know what's going on hence why I called your explanations to my questions out as lacking. I assumed that since the story is appareantly so great that there is more to it which you could point too since that is just basic framework of the whole situation framework that one could also btw miss if one played through the game blind the first time considering the game is clearly not meant to be 100% cleared by a player before defeating the last bosses for the first time. \n\nIn general I don't know why you keep trying to go for the ''You simply do not understand angle'' considering it is obvious that it is not my lack of knowledge of what is going on in Elden Ring that annoys me but that it is conveyed in what I find to be an extremely bad way.

You are searching so hard to pass the blame. The proletariat may have been transformed into currency cattle via years of cuts to public services and media brainwashing. But the matter of consent still rests on those who consume. They chose to continue listening to the propaganda. They continue to tune into fox CNN whatever daily paper is still surviving out there. The objective fact is that consent is in the hands of the individual. I do not consent to mainstream media. therefore I do not consume it and the karmic debt is not passed along to me. Anyone of us no matter how dumb makes that choice. Whether the consent is manufactured or not is a different argument. The simple fact is that any of you could stand up and choose not to listen and choose to actually get to know your community and see they are just human too. Until we reverse this hell instantiated in the 80s the disinformation will continue at full force.

If questioning of the country's action in the hallowed past is permitted questioning of the government's present actions soon follows.\n\nBy this method they make questioning of the nation thus questioning of themselves tantamount to being unpatriotic. \n\nThis works *because* most of the people who like to who ask such questions who recognise their country and government have done misdeeds are in fact great patriots. \n\nTheir questions can be effectively silenced by using their patriotism against them to make them feel disloyal for questioning.",6

It\'s the same kind of treatment that homophobic parents give their kids yet GC is adamant that *Jazz Jennings\'s parents* and not *Leelah Alcorn\'s parents* are the people committing child abuse.  \n\nImagine being GC saying "we don\'t need more varieties of chains we need to break the chains " and then approvingly citing Zucker and cheering parents who punish their teenager for being trans--or even for dressing in a GNC manner.  \n\nExhibit A: GenderCriticalDad whose blog post made it onto Fundies Say The Darnedest Things. \n\n Exhibit B: ThrowZoeAway\'s mother RunSilverStreaks.\n\n  Exhibit C: a mother on GC who forced her teenager to check "she/her" in ink on a form for the school drama team and even complained when said teenager wore androgynous instead of stereotypically feminine clothing.  \n\nAnother poster complained that a sub for butch women was encouraging to eggs and trans people instead of following the line GC wants.  That line being "never transition no matter how much dysphoria you have just be a GNC woman!"\n\nCatsBatsAllThat brags about making HRT contraband for homeless trans teenagers at her shelter yet I\'m supposed to believe GC doesn\'t hate trans people and just objects to Riley Dennis.,8

*Cracks knuckles adjusts jaw straightens back takes sip of water pops neck.*\n\nFrostpunk is a 2019 city builder made by the Polish studio 11bits famous for their game This War Of Mine. Frostpunk is about the last cities on earth in a Steampunk 1887 world where a massive global cooling event has rendered most of earth uninhabitable. You take the role of The Captain the leader of one of these cities. The central idea of Frostpunk is a mixture of resource management and society simulator where you not only need to balance the production of things like coal steel raw food cooked food and wood but also need to sign laws to drastically impact how your city runs. Everything from child labor to crowding medical centers and even legalizing poverty grade soup to stretch your rations your choices effect how the city runs. Perhaps you sign Emergency Shifts to force 24 hours of straight labor for a day? I mean the coal mines must flow the Generator cannot stop. Speaking of the generator your generator is the central point of the city. It uses your coal to heat buildings around it as cold is directly related to sickness and too much sickness causes your workers to stop working or even die! Or perhaps you\'re a good person in which case you may choose Child Shelters and Apprenticeships over child labor or expensive Prosthetics to get your amputees back to work. \n\nBut that\'s just the adaption laws! When something happens that calls for drastic measures you will look to the Purpose law tree! Here you choose between Order or Faith. In the Order tree it starts simple with foremen unarmed neighborhood watchmen and morning gatherings. But when things start to get out of control options like imprisonment propaganda and even The New Order offer to fix your mistakes. In the Faith Tree it starts simple with shrines and churches but later down the line Faith Keepers flagellation and even becoming The Protector Of The Truth may sound a bit more nice to... Remind people that God is watching!\n\nThe coal life never ends though for in the DLC The Last Autumn you take control of The Foreman! The head of New Liverpool\'s site where you build the generator! Deal with Motivation where your workplace speed and efficiency is directly tied to how good of a boss you are. But when workplace accidents become more common you must either lean on the Workers or the Engineers! The workers promise motivation and unorthodox solutions while the Engineers promise efficiency and... Pragmatic solutions. It\'s all fun and games until you\'re a communist fearmongerer executing those who don\'t agree with the Union or perhaps are a literal work camp and are bringing in cheap convicts with every shipment from the mainland. I wonder what your boss will think when you request some more workers and the boat coming in sees "work makes you free" on your bloody gates.\n\nThe City Must Survive. The coal life never ends.,5

Yep. And it\'s the same shit with Hollywood actresses.\n\nSure I know in some cases a young woman is legitimately taken advantage of when she\'s too young to truly understand the weight of her actions and therefore she later regrets it.\n\nBut it\'s absolutely ridiculous to me how often we see the following pattern play out. An actress will use her looks for her career doing topless scenes to get mileage out of her huge boobs taking roles which lean into her being sexy as hell dolled up at every turn. But then the *second* she gets old enough that her looks aren\'t enough to get her roles anymore she\'ll make some public statement about how terrible it is that Hollywood sexualized her like that.\n\nIt\'s just embarrassing. Take some accountability for your own actions. You knowingly used your looks to advance your career for 10 years. That\'s perfectly fine. I\'m not judging you for doing that. But don\'t turn around and act like you didn\'t do that on purpose just because now it\'s no longer an option for you.\n\nIt\'s so consistent. If you ever see a super sexy Hollywood actress get old enough that you see a picture of her and think "Oh wow she\'s getting old" start a countdown for the inevitable article about how being sexualized is evil and bad and wrong.,8

Itâ€™s literally the exact opposite of what you said. The basis of its epistemology is that you should reason about your perceptions to reach conclusions. The politics of objectivism in broad is that the government should stay out of economics and should only exist to protect the rights of its citizens. The ethics is that you should protect and pursue your own self-interest not just at the material level. The metaphysics is that existence exists consciousness exists as the faculty of perceiving existence and everything is itself. There is no â€œfollow meâ€ in there in fact Rand specifically states at multiple points throughout her nonfiction works that you are welcome to question her conclusions and in fact encourages it.

Bernie consistently was the most popular candidate among lower income and working class voters and was endorsed by many workers unions. Not to mention that Sanders policies would undoubtedly help working class people and families much more than any other dem candidate running. Medicare For All alone  would benefit lower income individuals and families immensely. And yeah he wants to eradicate student debt which I think is fair. Also I wish that people would let the â€œbut he has 3 housesâ€ argument die. His two homes (which he has because he lives and works in different places and must establish a residency) and his cabin are by no means mansions and even if they were it would not really matter to his base or contradict his policies.,0

What I mean is just because someone\'s trying to manipulate definitions do not abide by these new definitions and just decide to not use the words in protest as a response. You can and should keep using the words with their proper definitions.\n\nI see this all too much that even people who reject this shit still start using these new "definitions" while arguing against the ideology. For example it is now default accepted that a "trans woman" is a male who successfully transitioned as female. Even those who don\'t agree that you can actually change your sex still abide by this terminology. You see the problem? By using the wrong term "woman" you\'ve inherently accepted through language that a man does in fact really become a woman. Even if you claim to reject it.\n\nSo don\'t. Words matter. Especially if you\'re trying to make an argument.,4

What is scientific about "On average unvaccinated people are more susceptible to illness"?\n\nThat\'s complete rubbish you guys are always ill. You just made that shit up. At least I\'m basing what I\'m saying on real life experience. Take Covid for example. About 50% of people I know didn\'t get the jab. People struggling are the ones who got it across the board despite what the news tries to tell you. I know a lot of people I travel all around the country. It\'s the same stories everywhere. People have been seriously fucked up from those injections and on top of that they still get Covid. I haven\'t been ill this whole time. Most unjabbed people just had a flu and now they are continuing with their life. Meanwhile I hear no end to new health problems that vaccinated people are dealing with but they are too scared to face the truth and think that it could be the injection. Heart/blood problems? Cancer coming back? I know what caused it. I wish other people would start to notice.\n\nI know a lot of people who have never been vaccinated so it\'s not just me as I said before.

Homelessness is structural; the government has a *targeted* unemployment rate that they don't want to go under (it would give workers too much negotiating power and cause inflation) and the cost and bureaucracy of housing (along with a lack of access to affordable mental health and medicine) ensures that some portion of those unemployed will be homeless.  \n\nTo be clear if we reconfigured our systems in a way that ensured few or no homeless that would have all kinds of costs and downsides and may or may not be worth it.

Its not like its some random country town. \n\nThe lab workers being sick is also a coincidence but there is no verifiable way to know what they had. Covid presents the same way as a dozen other respiratory viruses. No one else at the hospital caught it so its a dead end. Sure it could have been covid but it also could have been the common cold or the flu. \n\nThe furin cleavage site being a new mutation is not suspicious whatsoever. Viruses mutate when a person has two viruses at the same time and genetic info is exchanged. Many common viruses express the furin virulence factor. If covid mutated naturally stealing the furin motif from another common virus is one of the most likely ways it would have mutated. \n\nAgain im not saying its impossible to have been a lab leak.

You forget humans have never been artificially bred like dog breeds. Humans do have slight genetic variation between groups but not even close to the extreme that dog breeds do.

Saying that humans are more genetically different than dog breeds has as much evidence behind it as the bell curve.,0

When companies did it back when it was politically contentious to do so I was happy to see it. Corporations willingly attaching themselves to the cause is a major signal boost and does help with normalization and societal acceptance. Between 1970-2010 corporations who chose to tie themselves to LGBT causes did so typically with the knowledge that doing so would likely have a negative effect on their bottom line. Their support of Pride was a moral decision and their continued support of it in 2020 is absolutely welcome. "Virtue Signaling" is a criticism does not apply to companies that were willing to support Pride when it wasn\'t politically expedient. Nor does it apply to companies that in present day are willing to harm their social credit in countries that are still anti-gay.\n\nHowever when companies waited until the late 2010s to jump on board it\'s just kind of dumb. Doesn\'t make me angry or anything it just makes me roll my eyes a bit and move on.\n\nWhen companies are callous about it like Bethesda is being here it pisses me off. Only supporting human rights where it is convenient to do so undermines any positive statement they supposedly were making.,4

That\'s where you\'re wrong bucko. We *are* doing it ourselves. And it is *hard*. We have the resources (advantages) we did plan. That doesn\'t make it any less precarious - if one of us gets sick or is hurt the wheel stops - and just because we were able to plan and do it right doesn\'t mean that we didn\'t have advantages to start with that others do not or that those advantages are permanent.\n\nWhere you and I differ is that I\'ve already lived some of this as well as our initial approach to society. There are people in worse financial and life situations than me who have family who can handle the reproductive work of care but lack earning power to rightfully give their kids their own time and also keep their families afloat.\n\nWhere you see people struggling and blame them as though they are inadequate or inherently flawed rather than largely products of the society and circumstances they are born into I think to myself "There but for the grace of God go I". The system we live under is deeply predatory and I don\'t think people should live so precariously in general I understand how easy it is to fall behind and get pulled under.\n\nYou take a tremendous amount for granted and feel worthy to cast judgement on people in life situations you haven\'t really fathomed and cannot empathize with. That\'s a lot of hubris which could really come back to bite you one day in ways you absolutely will not be able to control with any amount of planning.,0

It was called Othello\'s and you could get a lime phosophate there for 10 cents.\nMy friends said they were afraid of getting jumped on the walk home which I thought was just so dang racist. They also had licorice whips. So one day I said "No I\'m not walking that way we\'re staying." cause it was August and it was 94 or 95 degrees out there. So we went to Othello\'s instead and got some malts and one fella got a grape nehi.

"Being trans isn't a mental disorder. There are people who identify and live as a gender which does not correspond with their birth sex who lead happy productive more-or-less normal lives. This is in direct contradiction to the definition of mental disorder which requires that the psycological difference actively interfere with the sufferer's ability to function.\n\nGender dysphoria is a mental disorder because it interferes with their ability to function. People suffering from it face severe symptoms like depression anxiety self-loathing and the constant everpresent conviction that something is deeply wrong. The only way we've discovered to treat these symptoms is to help them transition. This makes them into ordinary trans people able to participate in society.",6

>Just because your society doesnâ€™t wisely recognize a third gender doesnâ€™t mean gender is a social construct you ignorant clown.\n\nYou can\'t even type that sentence to mean what you intend.\n\nYou can rationalise anything is a social construct because language is a social construct. Therefore anything you can articulate with language is arguably a social construct. But gender and sex are interlinked and in those societies with a third gender it is often forced upon the person and not necessarily an organic development. More importantly it is almost always a case of one sex wanting to be another when organic not the same as people trying to claim gender is a spectrum. The recognition of a "third gender" is nothing more than the acceptance that you want to be one but biologically you are the other. People who wake up and decide what gender they will be for the day are nothing more than degenerate elites engaging in a fetish.,5

(Australiaâ€™s obviously the only nation that covers the continent of Oceania) they donâ€™t border any other nations like how the US borders Mexico. scenario: So if somehow if lawful American gun owners weâ€™re to comply with new US gun laws like Australia wouldnâ€™t criminals say â€œlmao fuck that lawâ€ and cause ironically even more gun deaths in the US?,7

It\'s like the Israel/Palestine thing if I can exaggerate for effect. They aren\'t interested in getting along; they just wanna win. Take like 20 steps back and look at how this country functions...particularly MSM. It\'s a goddamn flea circus of a popularity contest. \n\nThe core of this country are Centrists at least at heart and it was no secret in the past that the Left and Right were fairly equally matched while the easiest way to victory was to court the undecided Centrists. Look how Centrists are treated now see /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM for a Reddit example and we\'re no longer courted but ostracized while extremists are the new beau.\n\nMSM is fucking cancer and the fact that 90% of it is Left leaning has a large part to do with it. If it was more "diverse" it wouldn\'t be like this. Considering how it stands the majority think the only Right leaning network is 100% conspiracy nutjob while also thinking the "opponent" is on the level. Just for the fun of it let\'s go over major network affiliation:\n\nOn the Left:\n\n* ABC\n\n* NBC\n\n* CBS\n\n* ESPN\n\n* CNBC\n\n* MSNBC\n\n* CNN\n\n* ~~TNT~~ TBS\n\n* Comedy Central\n\n* HBO\n\nOn the Right:\n\n* FOXNEWS\n\nEven taking auxiliary networks out it\'s still 6 v 1 in news networks. This makes it so FOXNEWS is treated as a conspiracy channel which it can be since it\'s the only one while the other 90% can just echo each other giving a greater air of credibility. They don\'t talk to each other because it\'s bad for the bottom line Bruce Almighty had this right when Jim Carey bitched about covering "biggest cookie" because nobody gives a shit about wholesome stories and network news almost closed up shop because they couldn\'t compete with 24/7 internet...but in a last ditch effort they went hardcore tabloid journalism.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Sabotage\n\n>*In Herbert\'s fiction sometime in the far future government becomes terrifyingly efficient. Red tape no longer exists: laws are conceived of passed funded and executed within hours rather than months. The bureaucratic machinery becomes a juggernaut rolling over human concerns and welfare with terrible speed jerking the universe of sentients one way then another threatening to destroy everything in a fit of spastic reactions. In short the speed of government goes beyond sentient control (in this fictional universe many alien species co-exist with a common definition of sentience marking their status as equals).*\n\n>*Founded by the mysterious "Five Ears" of unknown species BuSab began as a terrorist organization whose sole purpose was to frustrate the workings of government in order to give sentients a chance to reflect upon changes and deal with them. Having saved sentiency from its government BuSab was officially recognized as a necessary check on the power of government. It provides a natural (and lucrative) outlet for society\'s regular crop of troublemakers who must be countered by society\'s regular crop of "do-gooders"*,8

The first part of your response sounds more of a reaction to the unacceptable treatment of detainees during this current administration rather than an overall political stance. That\'s why I was asking more specifically the Open Borders stance. Nothing on record but "most likely a future plan" really translates to nothing on record for me at the moment. \n\nThe next paragraph is about the wall and halting deportations. Halting deportations doesn\'t sound like "free unrestricted citizenship or entry" into the US. That just sounds like freezing things so they don\'t get any worse (or any better). Many of these unregistered or illegal immigrants were already here not recently arrived. About tearing down sections of the wall in the same interview he also says "If itâ€™s going to cost me billions of dollars to tear it down maybe the money would be better spent on child care in this country." Not unreasonable. The wall is a ridiculous political talking point for both sides anyways.\n\nAgain I don\'t agree with labeling AOC\'s goals as Sanders\' goals unless he explicitly says so. That picture doesn\'t (gonna ignore the Reddit comments because Reddit comments) say anything about Sanders\'. To me it\'s just some young people taking pride in their culture who cares. They aren\'t going to "Latinonize" America. An increase in Latino population does not equate to a decrease in white/black/asian/whoever populations.\n\nHis 2007 comments about employing illegal immigrants and borders being porous are also referring migrant workers. I don\'t think the people worrying about immigration are concerned about people who come in slave away on some strawberries for a few bucks and leave when the season ends. They can take der jerbs. How strange that he\'s a Globohomo shill when the only detrimental arguments people have against Sanders\' is his immigration (sic- Mexican) stance. Maybe a Mexichomo would be more appropriate?,4

The weirdest part of all of this isn\'t the Pfizer exec or project Veritas .. but that nobody else does this job.  What I mean is ... 50 years ago EVERY news organization would have been doing stuff like this digging for the real story etc pressuring these companies but now nobody cares.  The question is .. WHY does nobody care ?  I don\'t just mean why isn\'t the main stream media reporting on this specific story I mean ... why isn\'t the news in general the least bit curious about things like this ?  Why don\'t they care that Covid-19 was probably started in a lab why don\'t they care about what Pfizer is doing etc ?\n\nThe only answer apparently has to be that they don\'t care because they\'re all big companies who are just letting each other do whatever they want.  The news doesn\'t care because it\'s owned by ... whoever ... and doing a story on Pfizer would just create bad feelings between mega corps so nobody wants to embarrass anybody.  These are no longer journalists .. these are just shills for companies doing whatever they have to do to protect the status quo and keep making money.  They only care about "news" when it is against anti-establishment people who aren\'t doing what is in their best interests.\n\nThree mile island was a huge story where a nuclear reactor went haywire back in the day ... the media was all over that story.  Now a world wide pandemic literally millions dead ... and it takes Project Veritas to go on a date with an exec at Pfizer to even ask WTF they are up to ?  AND STILL NOBODY CARES ?!?  Journalism is DEAD.  It\'s literally just there to propagandize the public.\n\nPfizer hasn\'t even responded to any of this ... and why would they need to since they know corporate media is never even going to ask them about it ?,4

It\'s not "_government money_" in most civilised countries employees pay some kind of tax which contributes towards a defined national pension. It exists because people characteristically do not contribute towards a pension when they\'re young and so when they get older and reach 60-65 and their bodies or minds physically cannot continue with the work they inevitably end up sick poor and homeless and become a massive burden on society (because of how compound interest works).\n\nIt\'s not much money by design since it only exists to meet people\'s basic needs but if you\'ve paid off your mortgage it\'s normally enough to live modestly and if you haven\'t you\'ll normally be entitled to some other benefits too (or you may need to keep working for a couple of years longer). You\'ll also almost always earn back more money than you put in because cross generational ponzi schemes are the only type of ponzi scheme that work between an expanded workforce and economic growth. You also only get the money if you\'ve been making contributions (i.e. have been in continuous employment with no extended periods of leave) and a liveable retirement is the least a government can do to compensate someone who has spent their entire working life paying taxes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the end of the day though it\'s really about your priorities. If you like walking past dying homeless people on the way to work then I guess maybe the tiny amount of additional financial autonomy you could have is worth more to you.,5

The fundamental belief behind CRT is that society itself is racist and no matter what individuals do or think even if each individual member of society isnâ€™t racist or is even anti-racist society itself will still be racist. Ultimately their goal is to completely destroy (or deconstruct as they would say) the foundations of western society. They believe the foundational norms of western society like the right to self-ownership and the idea that success should be based on merit are fundamentally racist. Proponents of CRT have no underlying ideology beyond this. They donâ€™t have actual beliefs on what an ethical society looks like. Essentially these people want to destroy the western norms that have lead to the most free and prosperous societies in world history for no reason other than some unprovable accusation that these norms are racist. The ideology isnâ€™t only nonsensical itâ€™s based entirely on hate for western prosperity with no focus on actual solutions to problems.,1

The problem is that legal finagling on the side of "trans rights" is actively eroding the definition of a protected class. Misogynist causes are now winning legal battles because the push to *change* "sex" to "gender" in the law has now given men the upper hand. Women are losing court cases after being fired for breastfeeding because "[men can breastfeed too](https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/02/angela-ames-sex-discrimination-case-breast-feeding-mom-loses-because-men-can-lactate-too.html)". Men are [destroying female only gym spaces](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/connecticut-supreme-court-rules-women-only-gym-areas-violate-state-discrimination-law/2700615/) because "they discriminate against the man-gender". Title IX is effectively gone due to the Equality Act.\n\nUnder these laws a man could easily demand that a woman baker frost something about cock superiority and win the case on the basis of "gender discrimination". But of course PCM would never make that comparison for obvious reasons so we\'re stuck with the Nazi one.,4

Just because we disagree about something does not mean we should merely toss it away. Everyone acknowledges that it has its shortcoming but that doesnâ€™t take away from what itâ€™s good at either. Itâ€™s a simple way for someone to identify where they are and what they believe in with regards to freedom and economy. \n\nYou could have another 2d compass for tradition/progressiveness and religion/atheism. Together I reckon they could show where someone lies. \n\nAlso there are seperate websites from political compass that include a tradition scale and others contain a lot more. \n\nAll in all I think itâ€™s a neat thing and that itâ€™s benefits out weight itâ€™s losses.,7

>Last time I checked nepotism isn\'t illegal\n\nThis isn\'t nepotism. Nepotism is choosing a family member over a more qualified person for a job. This is literally funneling funds from his campaign into his household. It\'s also *very* immoral. He ran his campaign as a "grass roots funding" run. We all know donors are sending money to politicians for their own benefit. This is worse than that. This is taking money meant for benefitting the people and instead going into the sanders household bank acc.\n\nSanders didn\'t appoint his wife as head of treasury he took campaign funds. No it\'s not illegal but it\'s incredibly immoral and undermines his entire message. How are you anti-capitalism yet constantly using our democratic capitalistic system to benefit you?\n\nThis is my biggest gripe with sanders. He stands for one thing but doesn\'t live by those same principals and people make excuses for him. I don\'t mind him writing books many people do. I\'m a big fan of "the War On Normal People" by Andrew Yang which properly explains his policy positions. Difference is Yang doesn\'t promote himself as one standard and completely undermine it by doling the opposite. He doesn\'t hide the fact he\'s a devout capitalist and a businessman. Sanders does.,1

Saying a country like Kazakhstan was "the Soviets" is the flaw I am pointing out.

It was just a lot different from the way US states have autonomy. The Baltic republics declared independence and had reforms earlier than the rest of the Soviet Union.

This just sounds like be a Lib-right with extra steps.\n\nAlso why are you closer to your neighbours than your family? I mean I don\'t mind I think family is highly overrated but generaly the idea is that children are highest priorities and parents are on equal standing I guess because children are more "valuable" but a parent would typicaly die for their child or so I am lead to belief and the otherway around is considered wrong / a tragedy.\n\nWhile within your neighbourhood you kind of look out for everyone but you don\'t share your wealth "unconditionaly" what is yours will never belong to your neighbour while it does belong to your family.\n\nLastly the problematic bit here is that this ignores historical context and since we don\'t start from 0 but instead a highly unequal position this absolutely massively benefits wealthy people over poor. Even if wealth was spread evenly it would be in peoples own best interest to move into as rich a neighbourhood as possible also it is impossible to know what external factors in your life lead to your success and just assumes that whoever is "physicaly closests" has most responsibility and therefore should benefit accordingly.\n\nPeak conservative voter mindset honestly I doubt many conservatives think fuck my family they can pull themselves up they don\'t deserve shit instead they are just people who care much more for people they are closer with as EVERYONE does by nature which is the entire fucking problem when there are more people around than you have contact with whether you want 99.9% of the population to have 0 influence on your life or not doesn\'t matter because A it can\'t happen nobody lives that isolated and B doesn\'t work because nobody can be informed on every topic.

"> ho said anything about completely separate cultures? \n\nYou did. You asked about cultural differences. You switched from 'general diversity within a society' to 'cultural differences.' You changed what question you were even asking. I need you to define some boundaries if you want an honest answer.\n\n> The point is that the more categories of overlap you find in a group the stronger the community. \n\nSupport this statement.\n\nYou literally lead up to this by pointing out that the boundaries are ever-shifting and not everything is evenly weighted but then end with a statement that more is always better.\n\n>  You started with a strawman about how traditionalists are scared of change and difference. \n\nTradition is literally about not changing.\n\n> What commonalities exist outside of culture that function as social bonds?\n\nWell for starters a lot of people view race as important to commonality even though race isn't a function of culture at all. \n\nLiking similar things isn't necessarily a function of culture and yet also helps form social bonds. I mean unless you're going to attribute every single action or desire any individual has to the monolithic idea of 'culture' this question doesn't even make sense.",6

Sure but this goes both ways.\n\nExpecting someone to quit McDonalds or being a waiter to go code or install HVAC might work on an individual level but it would be a disaster on the societal level as many of these jobs while being poorly paid are necessary for society to continue to function.\n\nOf course the moment the "free" market doesn\'t act the way corporations want it to they spout one liners such as:\n\n"Nobody wants to work anymore."\n\n"Why are the restaurants closed?"\n\n"Why are there no tradesmen?"\n\nThis is why worker rights are important and shouldn\'t be neglected.\n\nSure it might be easy to replace the local McDonald\'s janitor but what about the railroad workers?

"Errhm \n\nThere is no federal inheritance tax.  A few states have their own version of it though (state's rights yay?):\n\n>Inheritance tax and estate tax are two different things. Inheritance tax is what the beneficiary â€” the person who inherited the wealth â€” must pay when they receive it. Estate tax is the amount thatâ€™s taken out of someoneâ€™s estate upon their death. One both or neither could be a factor when someone dies.\n\n>There is no federal inheritance tax but there is a federal estate tax. The federal estate tax generally applies to assets over $12.06 million in 2022 and $12.92 million in 2023 and the estate tax rate ranges from 18% to 40%. Some states also have estate taxes (see the list of states here) and they might have much lower exemption thresholds than the IRS. Assets that spouses inherit generally aren't subject to estate tax.\n\n>Because the estate tax and inheritance tax are different some people can occasionally get hit with a double whammy. Maryland for example has an estate tax and an inheritance tax which means an estate might have to pay the IRS and the state and then the beneficiaries might have to pay the state again out of whatâ€™s left. However this isn't the norm across the country.\n\n[Source](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/inheritance-tax)\n\nHowever there is a federal estate tax and you'll hear Fox News bitch about it trying to trick their audience into it's removal usually baiting their audience with poor ol' farmers.  They never mention the whole 12 million or above part... for some reason.  Rich people are the *real* victims here am I right?\n\nSo like most tweets this one is also dumb.\n\nWait until this sub finds out how South Korea does it!",8

If they are forcefully breaking in to my business while I am inside it and they are either armed or in a group large enough to overpower me that\'s not shooting people just for breaking in. That IS defending my life. They want my stuff. I say "no" and stand in their way. They then have to harm me to get it.,1

Since 1900 auth governments have lost two world wars two democratic governments and collapsed starved millions of their own citizens to death lost the Cold War and then collapsed and in other first world countries like South Korea and Spain disintegrated and been replaced by more democratic governments. Of course you still have world leaders like Iran who the United States just cucked on the world stage after we openly assassinated one of their top general in their own back yard and when they couldnâ€™t do anything about it they shot down one of their passenger planes in their frustrated autistic flailing. Or China a country whose only power came from stealing western innovation and riding the prosperity of their one western held and democratic city who they still canâ€™t get under control and who the west owned for over a century before we finally agreed to let them have it back. Thereâ€™s also North Korea a country who is actively starving their citizens to death only recently mastered technology that everyone else has had for decades and who is completely reliant on foreign aid. \n\nAuth government havenâ€™t done shit for the last 120 years except be routinely humiliated by freer and more democratic governments. Of course maybe you were referring to some of the older and more historic governments like the empires of Britain and France which languished for hundreds of years in the dark ages before being overthrown by fed up peasants defeated by some uppity libertarian farmers lost all their colonies and now require the US military to defend them from the threat of Russia and China.,0

It included "eyewitness" accounts that didn\'t have a chance in hell of seeing/hearing the incident at any point and had embellishment so far from reality that I was shocked. \n\nWe\'re not talking "stretching the truth " no; this was entirely cut out of whole cloth.

Just ask yourself why it was posted there.\n\nThis shit happens all the time often going unreported by the media and most child rape/sexual exploitation is done by step-fathers in a same sex relationship.,0

Okay so fyi EU doesn\'t have a DNA database either. Same issue as USA only criminals basically: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11376989/\n\n> Would you find abortion preferable to being in the foster system?\n\nExtremely difficult question to answer because we can argue from both personal and societal viewpoints. From a societal viewpoint foster care does not seem to provide an adequate equivalent to a "true nuclear" family. Here is one such study from Texas:\n\nhttps://www.casey.org/media/StateFosterCare_TX_fr.pdf\n\n> Nearly seven in ten males (68.0%) had been arrested since leaving care 55.2% had been convicted of a crime and 62.3% had spent at least one night incarcerated. 2 Although the rates of criminal justice involvement were lower for females these rates were all higher than for the general population.\n\nAnd one from Wisconsin: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8975219/\n\n> Conclusion statement: Efforts to reduce incarceration risk for **all** youth in foster care are needed.\n\nWe see social disadvantages to the foster care system and furthermore a large percentage of foster children are in the system due to neglectful or abusive parents. The quality of life is overwhelmingly miserable for these children to the point where their maladaptation leads to legal and social consequences throughout their lives.\n\nI guess we\'d have to talk to them to ask whether each of them want to live though. Too bad we can\'t talk to fetuses.,5

That makes sense because I believe in some states you can drink on private property at 18. Not sure though.\n\nHowever drinking isnâ€™t the only thing thatâ€™s 21.

Again why canâ€™t I choose to ruin my body at 18 but I can be trusted to vote for something that will impact a whole country. \n\nTo me the easiest thing is that 18-21 isnâ€™t going to be the majority voting power so itâ€™s not like whoever they vote for is automatically the winner. There would have to be some other age group that also votes the same for them to carry which is why I do not particularly care.,4

Mother of God. \n\nThe fact that you still can\'t get it into your head that making single mothers more poor won\'t help the situation at all shows how ignorant you are. \n\nHell let\'s say there\'s some truth in what you\'re saying. \n\nThe issue is that politicians don\'t look long-term.

There\'s a few factors at play here:\n\n1. The gun is a replica Single Action Army revolver. You can see the contents of all six chambers with a little due diligence.  \n2. There was no need for anyone to be standing behind the camera that\'s the whole point of Teradeks and wireless monitoring.  \n3. The fact that crew had been using the props for impromptu target shooting should have triggered an immediate "alright why the fuck are there real bullets present on set" moment.  \n4. Going back to the model of gun it\'s impossible for one to spontaneously fire (seriously people tested hitting the firing mechanism with sledgehammers to see if it could be jarred into misfiring from a half-back position). The ***only*** way it can fire is with pressure on the trigger. He should not have had his finger on the trigger (trigger discipline) during framing of the shot or test viewing only with cameras rolling.,8

I agree the linked article was scant on details. And I don\'t care if you don\'t want to spend 60 seconds tracking down the original work. The issue is you started making claims about the "factors considered" without looking into the work at all.\n\nIf it makes you feel better redditors fall for this stupid bias all the time. Anytime a study disagrees with their beliefs people start throwing out dumb criticisms without actually looking at it. You\'re the millionth person to say "study didn\'t consider X" when it explicitly did.\n\nIt might sound crazy but it turns out professional researchers usually know how to run a study. Instead of assuming your knee-jerk reaction has insight they never considered during years of work maybe actually check it? Or don\'t check it just don\'t state preach your ignorance as if it is fact.,4

Sort of. Egypt was ruled by different peoples at different times but *mostly*  it was ruled by peoples who would resemble the modern Egyptians. That said the Nubians did rule Egypt for a little bit (very brief all things considered) and there were enough actual Black Africans in Egypt for a distinction to be made between them and other Egyptians though these Blacks were mostly slaves. In the later years even Greeks and then Romans came to rule over Egypt. Cleopatra herself was probably Mediterranean and of Greek descent (also likely incredibly inbred). \n\nAnyway the point is there is a lot of nuance to the whole "who were the Egyptians" question. The "We Wuz Kangs" crowd aren\'t *entirely*  incorrect which just makes Khemet and other "Black Egypt" movements even more hilariously dumb in retrospect because they rarely acknowledge the *actual*  African influence in Egypt by trying to broadly paint it as a "Black land".,3

Ethiopia doesnâ€™t get enough respect.

Morocco currently holds the oldest human fossils at roughly 300 000 years.It was such a force in the 3rd century that many place it among Rome Persia and China as one of the greatest powers of the era. Other than the end of the Aksum empire which was huge deal but not necessarily relevant they really didnâ€™t lose their global political impact until WW2 when the Italians occupied them and then later in 1974 when the Soviets succeeded in a coup to install the Derg. Which fucked shit up and left behind a horrible mess before collapsing and being replaced by an even worse version of what came before them.\n\nEdit: learned that my original statement about Ethiopia holding the oldest human fossils was wrong theyâ€™re actually in Morocco.,1

They complained that tariffs mostly hurt American consumers (which they do).\n\nNo they talked about how China would win how it would be a sputnik moment for them to build semiconductoring chips.

They picked their side CCP supporting bastards. \n\n\n>Also just because *you* think that calling it the \'China Virus\' or the \'Kung Flu\' is somehow pointing at the CCP doesn\'t mean that everyone does.

You are the one conflating the nation of China (and it\'s CCP controlled government) with Han Chinese as a race you lying dishonest fuck no one else is doing that. \n\n>The first post you linked from r/politics was about the link between using language like \'the China virus\' and a rise in hate crimes showing that a President being irresponsible imprecise and frankly childish with his language has real consequences.\n\nðŸ™„ It\'s literally simping for China. Simping for the CCP. \n\n>If you want to call out the CCP then call out the CCP.

Those are all good points but I think even in the 1780s and 90s when they were envisioning the future I believe they set in place compromises which they knew would inevitably lead to a "shit or get off the pot" type scenario with slavery as well as many other issues. I think it\'s revisionist to say they weren\'t small L liberal just because after a long expensive bloody war they didn\'t look to settle slavery and a number of issues immediately and if you judge it by todays standards of what constitutes liberal. They had to form a union and to do that some principles had to be sacrificed or even seem contradictory in the face of a line like "all men are created equal."\n\nI can\'t know for sure but I think they envisioned setting up a scenario that would eventually birth a more perfect union that would be able to address that at some point in the future once we got our feet underneath us as a nation.\n\nThat may be looking at history with rose-colored glasses I admit but IMO it\'s better than looking at it with the shit-stained glasses we see too much when judging the past through today\'s standards and retconning so much of the motivation throughout history. The founder\'s themselves often lamented some of the things they had to allow to continue in order to actually be able to create the nation but even so the structure of the government was one of checks and balances with the idea that no one branch could be lorded over the other and further checks and balances in the legislative by making one democratically elected and one representative of states rights well before that term became synonymous with just racism but actually referred to the ideal of federalism where big populous states wouldn\'t be able to run roughshod over little states. IMO it was designed specifically to be against setting up monarchy/nobility like ruling class. Washington led by example stepping down after two terms so it\'s clear they did not expect for their to be a ruling class although yes they did want an educated electorate and politicians. They wanted literacy for voters not initially as a means to create a poll tax against minorities but because regardless of which side of issues you were on back then the uneducated mob was a horrifying idea to the founders but it seen as a great boon to many politicians today and I\'m not singling out a party on that. Ignorance is an asset to many politicians. \n\nThere\'s so many problems today though that are far beyond just the structure of the gov\'t but also the media cultural etc that I don\'t think even my idea of perfect governance structure would help that much and would just be re-arranging deck chairs on the titanic honestly.,8

"Lamo i mean degenerates. Married couples can have as much sex as they want in fact a nationalist government would probably encourage it to raise the birth rate. You know what the right means cucks simps pologmy cheaters drug addicts etc. People who are completely individualistic who don't care about anyone or anything other than themselves and their immediate wants. They don't even care about their own long term needs really. People who push away family community their people and their nation. People who have no self control and want to fuck everything they see including underage kids and vulnerable people. And people who 'just' cheat/hookup and create a lot of pain and sorrow through their selfish wants by creating out of wedlock children who will grow up statistically worse more depressed violent poorer and much more likely to end up in prison or die early. All because they just wanted to nut right that minute and couldn't even bother to use protection that's degenerate and selfish. People who enjoy seeing their wife be fucked off course and people who put every women on a pedastal and think they can do no wrong and buy their bathwater. And people who think men are inherently bad. People who enjoy seeing their people be breed out and displaced through mass migration and people who actively promote racial miscegenation. People who want to push homosexuality on others and on kids. You know what i don't care if someone is gay its mainly genetic but don't push it on little kids and try to normalize it to people who weren't born gay. And trannies of course that is a mental disease that should be treated with compassion and care with comprehensive medical care rather than normalizing it as some sort of' personality' or 'way of live'. Oh ya people who base their entire identity and being based on their sexuality on whatever gets their cock or vagina wet. There is alot more to live than sexuality. Oh and off course people who don't keep a stable partner and just keep having one night stands who don't really love anyone and just pursue a live of pure hedonism and short term pleasure instead of instead of true happiness and fulfillment. \n\nBasically reverting to how life was just a few decades ago and how it was for all of human history . In stable loving relationships that produce healthy well adjusted happy kids in loving homes. In supportive communities where people have a purpose and meaning greater than themselves where they have lots of true friends and can feel fulfilled and safe. I think a lot of degeneracy is a product of capitalism to sell more products and push people to just pursue hedonism and short term pleasure over happiness. And if people pursue a live of hedonism then they will consume more products for short term pleasure just to get some short respite from work. And off course with how much people have to work nowadays that off course makes stable long term relationships more difficult to obtain and maintain. People don't organically meet irl nearly as much studys back this up. And dating apps aren't exactly conducive to finding a life long partner instead it just promotes degeneracy. And off course if people don't have a nuclear family and if they don't have a extended family then they can't share what they have they have to buy more stuff and more cars and rent an apartment just for themselves and fill the hole in their heart with materialism and short flings. Perfect for capitalism. And extra surplus consumption also hurts the environment obviously. \n\nYou know we really just want people to be happy and fulfilled. How happy are people today really? Depression and suicide have never been higher at a time where degeneracy and capitalism is at its peak. People where significantly happier and more fulfilled in the past and studies show that the Amish have some of the lowest depression and suicide rates in the nation. If people have loving long term relationships and marriages and raise their kids lovingly as a family unit with decent working times and pay reasonable housing costs and support from the government then people will really be happier in the end. If people are really part of a community and have a greater meaning in life along with their extended family they will be fulfilled. And i think that's what really matters instead of just pursing short term goals and pleasures like an animal that in the end leaves one empty and unfulfilled.",5

1. That\'s why farm subsidies and federal grants to states exist. The rural poor have very different needs from the urban poor. Do you seriously think red-state senators and congressmen would get elected if they showed the middle finger to their base? But all the big media commentators are based in New York so WTF would they know about the concerns of voters in Wyoming or rural Texas?\n\n2. I don\'t know what your point here is. If anything Dems are more elitist than Republicans. College-educated women make up the largest demographic of Democratic Party voters. If you remove racial minorities from the Democratic Party all you\'re left with is a bunch of woke activists. And the only racial minorities that matter vote-wise are blacks. Asians are too few to truly matter and Latinos keep voting both ways more and more. The whole immigration kerfuflle is solely for their benefit. Other than that it\'s elitist nonsense and sexual politica. This social elitism is the reason blue collar workers (who were reliable Democratic voters for years) switched parties to the red team.\n\n3. Anita Hill\'s testimony was suspect. She followed Thomas from the DoE to the EEOC. Why would she do that if he was such a horrible boss? She could have stayed put and be rid of him. Why did she keep calling Thomas after they had stopped working together? And why the hell did she stay quiet until she was tracked down and talked into testifying by liberal senate aides after Thomas was nominated for a Supreme Court seat? The motive stinks and the logic makes no sense. \n\nIt was character assassination pure and simple. Watching porn is not a character failing and neither is saying a few bad words in the right context. \n\nThere\'s a lot of banter that gets twisted way out of shape.

**[White flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight)** \n \n >White flight or white exodus is the sudden or gradual large-scale migration of white people from areas becoming more racially or ethnoculturally diverse. Starting in the 1950s and 1960s the terms became popular in the United States. They referred to the large-scale migration of people of various European ancestries from racially mixed urban regions to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions. The term has more recently been applied to other migrations by whites from older inner suburbs to rural areas as well as from the U.S. Northeast and Midwest to the milder climate in the Southeast and Southwest.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5),4

Depends on how oneâ€™s political epistemology is grounded. \n\nI went from a young man basing my political beliefs upon what I deemed a principle of moral fairness â€” if not outright utilitarianism in the is-ought reparative framework â€” to now centering them based upon the best available peer-reviewed data. When the data conflict then we must weigh policies on their demonstrable empirical outcomes. \n\nFor instance while I understand and approve of the values of The Great Society there is so much conflicting evidence that cash welfare has destroyed black homes in particular â€” most of which has originated from black scholars incidentally. \n\nAnd while the Adoption and Safe Families Act seems a good idea on paper in reality [we have destroyed black families by government fiat](https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=njlsp) essentially rendering poverty a grounds for the removal of oneâ€™s children via the threat of state force.  \n\nJust because someone has spent a few months absorbing different ideas and their opinions have evolved is not enough to say that OP is unprincipled rather it is to say that at the least OP is not dogmatic. \n\nIâ€™m not going to assume bad faith or weakness on OPâ€™s part.,8

If the times were so different why did so many fight to end chattel slavery for centuries? Why did so many women over the year fight for rights?\n\nThatâ€™s not politics itâ€™s just humanity. Itâ€™s telling once rulers were getting executed people starting getting their rights. People were the same they were just under brutal dictatorships for a long time. \n\nWhy shouldnâ€™t the views of enslaved white Christians matter? How you treat the lowest in your society days a lot about the society. The Ottomans did a ton of terrible things that contemporary sources were appalled by. \n\nThe crusaders were largely terrible too. They ransacked Christian cities and looted and raped during their â€œholy pilgrimages.â€,6

You\'re allowed to acknowledge that systematic racism is a thing while there are also trends in attitudes towards education and work culture that don\'t help marginalized groups as well.\n\nMy belief in favor of systematic racism being a thing is a bit different in that I believe that in general viewing someone as "other" will put them at a disadvantage.

Study after study conducted in just about every country reveals that having a foreign sounding name is a surefire way to worsen your job prospects even when controlling other factors to be exactly the same as the person with the "normal" name.,0

I copied your replies manually to quote them because Iâ€™m on mobile. \n\nBesides the fact that I asked for a dictionary definition not a Wikipedia generalisation of several studies that provide different definitions for it â€œsexual behaviourâ€ isnâ€™t just sexual intercourse which is probably why â€œsexual behaviourâ€ was used instead. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity\n\nAnd even if that summarisation was 100% correct homosexuality isnâ€™t recorded statistically as a sexuality - gay is. So if you wanted to follow Wikipediaâ€™s definition of homosexuality you totally could but then implying that gay people who supposedly make up 5% of the population are more likely to be child abusers based on your definition of homosexuality that includes everyone who has ever had any form of same sex intercourse is problematic because censuses of LGBT ppl most definitely does not include everyone who has had same-sex intercourse. \n\nMost dictionaries actually have clarifications that the term homosexuality is outdated (because of its historical usage) but regardless the most consistent aspect of each different definition is â€œsexual attractionâ€ not sexual activity which actually makes sense. There are many homosexual people whoâ€™ve never had same-sex intercourse but theyâ€™re still a homosexual. Meanwhile many straight people have â€œexperimentedâ€ with same sex intercourse and concluded that they were straight after that. The biggest issue with saying that everyone whoâ€™s experienced same-sex intercourse is a homosexual is that it implies that those who are sexually abused by men are also homosexuals which I personally think is a fucked up assertion. \n\nYour final point on basic maths is just dumb. On top of correlation not implying causation (which is why I make it point to say that heterosexuality has no bearing on child sexual abuse despite more than [82%](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/children-and-teens)of child sexual abuse victims being girls at the hands of men) because sexuality according to multiple studies has proven to not have a feasible link to sexual abuse your statistic on male on boy CSA is just false. The vast vast majority (im talking well above 66%) of CSA victims are girls. Here are various stats I found just from a simple google search:\n\nhttps://www.rainn.org/statistics/children-and-teens\n \n1 in 53 boys experience CSA which is 1.89%\n\nhttps://victimsofcrime.org/child-sexual-abuse-statistics/\n\nSelf reports suggest that 5-10% of adult males recall CSA experiences. \n\nhttps://www.d2l.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all_statistics_20150619.pdf\n\n1 in 25 boys are sexually abused before they turn 18 which is about 4%.\n\nEven if we absolutely had to accept your claim that sexuality is a â€œdeterminerâ€ for CSA the notion that men are abusing boys at absurdly higher rates is straight up false. Thereâ€™s no single statistic thatâ€™s completely accurate but none of it suggests that 1/3 of CSA victims are boys. The main takeaways?\n\n1. Sexuality and CSA arenâ€™t linked. I am being very serious when I say virtually every study and statistic on the matter paints environment as most important factor in CSA. \n2. Having same-sex intercourse or some sort of sexual interaction in your lifetime doesnâ€™t determine your sexuality - sexuality isnâ€™t something that changes based on what you do. It is purely attraction towards the same sex. Have you ever been sexually aroused by a dude? No? Then youâ€™re probably straight. \n3. Even if we accepted this supposed link statistics on the number of male on boy CSA does not suggest that gay and bi men are abusing children at absurdly higher rates compared to heterosexual men. Still the most negligible point here honestly. \n\n\nAm I fundamentally misunderstanding something here or is this whole shoehorning of sexuality into CSA completely pointless and backed up by nothing but prejudice and bias?\n\n(After writing homosexual so many times I realise that gay is probably the better - and honestly more accurate - term to use).,6

\n\nWe might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their ancestors - thomas jefferson\n\n\nConsider the 14th Amendment. No part of the Constitution speaks more powerfully to the power of law to transform social relations. It guarantees that no state shall â€œdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.â€ And yet the Constitution still today counts a slave as â€œthree-fifthsâ€ of a person. Or consider the 13th Amendment. It abolishes slavery but the Fugitive Slave Clause â€” which requires escaped slaves to be returned to their masters â€” remains in the Constitution\n\nThe Constitutionâ€™s outdated language extends also to gender. It tells us that men alone can be president referring only to â€œheâ€ or â€œhisâ€ when referring to the presidency. Of course this did not prevent Hillary Clinton from becoming the first woman in 2016 to lead a major party into the general election. Nor does it stop other women from vying for the nomination now. But when Jeannette Rankin became the first woman elected to the House of Representatives some argued that the Constitutionâ€™s use of the masculine pronoun disqualified her.\n\nThe Constitution is replete with obsolete and outdated language that weakens rather than enhances the feeling of belonging that a constitution should generate among a countryâ€™s citizens.\n\nour mother fucking founding fathers literally said: that we should â€œprovide in our constitution for its revision at stated periods.â€ â€œ[E]ach generationâ€ should have the â€œsolemn opportunityâ€ to update the constitution â€œevery nineteen or twenty years â€ thus allowing it to â€œbe handed on with periodical repairs from generation to generation to the end of time.â€,8

Trump and his team of attorneys attempted to use the court system to overturn the election.

There simply wasnâ€™t wide spread voter fraud on the level necessary to make up for the millions of votes. Trump recently let go of his legal team and has stopped pursuing any more cases. The left didnâ€™t steal an election they won it. Trump failed in the court system and as such we will respect the Representative democracy/constitutional republic our founding fathers created.,7

I definitely feel like you got scammed.

But those are administered by trafikverket so that\'s "just" daddy gov fucking you and not private coorporations. The theory test is pretty hard but is completely digitised nowadays so no dickheads there again administered by trafikverket. I\'ve also heard stories of people spending thousands and thousands of dollars on the tests but TBH I\'m just glad a person who fails a driving test 50 times isn\'t on the roads. Sweden has pretty damn safe roads considering how sparsely populated it is with long rides for a lot of people. Atleast some of it is due to the increasing difficulty of driving tests.\n\nDriving isn\'t very uncommon at all in Sweden except in the big cities and even there the further out from the centre you get the more common owning a car becomes compared to the US though for sure it\'s more uncommon though I\'m fairly sure that disregarding stockholm alone would put us WAY closer.

>The typical British household uses 3 kW electricity a day. A solar panel installation worth about 6400 pounds is capable of producing 4 kW.\n\nWhat the fuck does this even mean? A kilowatt is a unit of instantaneous power not amount of energy. Also [a typical British household uses 8 kilowatt-hours per day not 3](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/energy-advice-households/average-gas-and-electricity-use-explained).\n\n>a solar panel will make more energy than you use in the day which you can sell back to the grid. Then any leftover consumption can be bought from the grid at night.\n\nMy guy where do you think the energy goes? You still need *some* kind of battery because there is a mismatch between the times of peak energy production and the times of peak energy consumption. Sure centralizing storage can improve efficiency but you would still need massive storage capacity to account for the possibility of sustained overcast weather during the winter.,7

"Point 1: is definitely racist but has been retracted.\n\nPoint 2: has been retracted.\n\nPoint 3: Obama did hold semi racist beliefs growing up as detailed in his first biography that can partly be explained by his own insecurities growing up.

I believe that Shapiro is probably what you'd call a homophobe on a personal level but he is pro gay marriage and believes that the government should keep out on moral matters (in complete opposition to fascism...)\n\nPoint 7: This one is tricky for people not familiar with Judaism. Judaism is both a Volk (what is the English translation of that word) and a religion due to them not taking in converts. In modern times however as atheism has spread a lot of Jews have begun mixing with the general population. I'm for example 30 % ashkenazi jewish but member of the Danish christian church. Therefore I'm ethnically somewhat Jewish but I'm not a Jew. That distinction doesn't make sense in any other popular religion and causes a lot of confusion. I understand that it's annoying for Jews to have someone who clearly doesn't participate in the religion speak on behalf of them on the basis of DNA. \n\nAs for me I consider myself conservative but in a Danish context when I took the test I was lib left and thought I'd just roll with it.\nI'm pro progressive tax system pro free healthcare hardliner on immigration issues (this is completely normal in Europe but frowned upon in America for some reason) pro life against the death penalty I believe all men should serve in the military I believe there are only two genders.

Libleft isn't saying strong = better they just imply that they personally would rather be physically strong than weak.\n\n>Feminism doesnt NOT support physical fitness it simply doesnt require it just like it doesnt require a beauty standard.\n\nWell not really feminism's goal is 'female empowerment' - libleft is literally saying the lack of promoting physical fitness detached from beauty leads to physically weaker women which is contrary to the goals of female empowerment - as a physically fit person has more agency and therefore is likely to be 'empowered'. The meme is implying libleft believes physical fitness is at least somewhat required to achieve personal empowerment - that's an apolitical belief.\n\n>Commenting on what people do with their bodily autonomy is unneccesary and establishes a hierarchy. \n\nNo it doesn't?

"You don't understand what makes a centrist (something I am not) by posting that. Centrism doesn't mean you can't take a definitive stance on an issue or you think everything has to be a 50/50 split. Centrists just typically have views that make it tough to place them on the right or left. For example they might support abortion rights but be opposed to higher taxes. One is a view typically assigned to people on the left the other for people assigned to those on the right. That makes them more of a centrist because you can't place them on one side or the other. It sounds like you have a very poor understanding of politics. Whoever made that image must also be fairly stupid. The KKK is far right and virtually all centrists would take objection to most of what the KKK thinks on racial issues. While asking for equal civil rights is very mainstream especially today. It shouldn't have to be explained to you but centrists would undeniably side with the civil rights activists who want equal treatment as that's something virtually all people would advocate for. I recommend you brush up on your politics better before you get angry and start posting nonsense. That image is embarrassingly bad.",1
Bad news: "The left" (in this case meaning most doctors/scientists/medical establisment) haven\'t lost credibility with normal people because of the good news: 20 million people haven\'t died from the vaccine.,3
Honestly I\'d say that there\'s kind of a prisoners dilemma. I think a lot of people on the left are tired of wokeness and a lot of people on the right are tired of the far right fringe but neither side will repudiate their radicals because the other side won\'t and they fear the other sides\' radicals more.\n\nPeople often feel forced into picking a side based on whose ideological excesses are the more immediate threat. Some others might simply accept that both are bad and pick a side based on which one is less likely to mess with them.\n\nThe problem the left has is that it\'s become culturally elitist and too dominated by upper middle class academics setting the agenda. Another problem they have is they slam the right so hard for being innately immoral not just wrong. So somebody who has a far right phase as a youth has no reason to ever switch sides since they are already cancelled anyway. The right meanwhile gives podiums to converted leftists.\n\nThere needs to be a path back to the mainstream for young men radicalized by the far right. The left is willing to accept this with young criminals the same logic applies here. So a kid robs a gas station at 17 he might very well traumatize the people there but doesn\'t kill anyone. That kid should not be paying for that when he\'s 47 if you make him unemployable he will stay a criminal. The same thing applies if some kid puts up a bad tweet or likes Tate if he\'s "cancelled" permanently there\'s a good chance he will believe the same stuff in his 30s instead of moderating.,7

I don\'t want to respond to every single individual comment but for the people writing "just don\'t depend to the governement at all" : you\'re missing the point.\n\nThe joke is that some librights shits on governements at basically every opportunity but when some peoples feel like their governement did a stupid decision about a social policy and go protest the same librights will take the side of the governement because "muh this social policy shouldn\'t be there in the first place".\n\nLike mate if you want to shit on the governements you should probably support the strikers bullying their own governement to get what they want instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : Some people clearly don\'t know how France works. You CAN stop working when you want to if you got the money to sustain yourself. The governement DOESN\'T enforce a retirement age. You don\'t technically DEPEND on the governement\n\nHowever unlike the US you can stop working at a certain age and get a retirement pension paid by the state.\n\nWhen you fulfil the recquired years you get a full pension which is usually enough to keep you afloat with your own economies. If you quit before your pension will not be as full. But everyone can technically retire at the retirement age and get a full pension they can live with.\n\nThis is made to avoid people working until 70 because they don\'t have the money to retire - I think it\'s what happens in the US for the poorest.\n\nThe protests are about how people don\'t want to have to work longer to get their full pensions and also asks Macron to make economies on other sectors/tax the richest and the big companies.\n\nIt\'s not EXACTLY how that works but I\'m oversimplifying so you can understand.,2
Consider perhaps that being in constant intense discomfort with oneâ€™s body might fuel existing mental issues and traumas. \n\nConsider then that dismissing out of hand the obvious and effective solution to the ways in which this fuels their issues might cause further pain to the person afflicted.\n\nAdditionally consider that for some such people were they to find euphoria in presenting a certain way - only to have their access to that taken away by â€œconcernedâ€ family members - such direct and sometimes even cruel revocation of their happiness might again fuel or create traumas or mental illnesses.\n\nPlease donâ€™t be so hurried to attribute mental illness to a matter of identity at its core lest you contribute to the very issues you appear to be concerned about.,0

If the winner picks the lump sum that $2.04 billion drops to $997.6 million. Of course that is\xa0before\xa0taxes. To get the full $2.04 billion instead the winner would have to pick the 30 annual payments. That works out to about $68 million a year again before taxes.

I mean that\'s not an unheard of perspective. "Traditional values" is definitely a dogwhistle term and a strict belief in the traditional nuclear family as the structural center of society is frequently comorbid with a fascist perspective on the social order. It\'s inherently hierarchical.,2
Libertarians are mostly just in favour of freedom to do what *they* want to do without any obligations to give back to society. Based on my experience posting here as a right to die advocate; the large majority of librights are even opposed to a legally codified to commit suicide (not even "assisted" suicide just suicide with privately arranged access to an effective method). And that is the most clear-cut and fundamental example of personal and private liberty that there is (more so than abortion). But yet they will still advocate for heavy-handed government interference in that choice because they believe that everyone who doesn\'t value life as they value it is too delusional to be allowed to make personal choices. And I\'m sure that if you isolate any liberty that they morally disagree with they\'ll find some sort of loophole as to why that particular example doesn\'t count.,0

Class struggle isnt objectively provable as classes are just abstractions. Its only individuals that exist objectivelly. You can talk all you want about the working class the proletariat the capitalist class just as you can talk about the IT guys class the ruling class the enterpreneurial class the academic class because these are just man-made constructs to categorize people\n\nin fact one of the biggest flaws of classic economics that probably influenced marx\'s thought was thinking of economics as relationships within classes so they categorized stuff by producers consumers distributors etc and wrongly thought distributors producers and workers were competing for the same "pie" and if one earned more the others would earn less which is like zero-sum phallacy 101\n\nSo most of marx\'s assumptions about how economy and the world works was based on the mainstream economy of his time which was showing tons of cracks and contradictions and was finally debunked in the late 19th century while marx was still alive\n\nHe even corrected some of it based on the new economic discoveries going towards a kind of neoclassical/keynesian "market balance" theory but marxists dont seem to care about those fixes\n\n> Marx realised the problem and promised its solution in the third volume of Capital. When that book was published posthumously in 1894 the solution turned out to be: competition! Marx wrote that â€˜These different rates of profit are equalized by competition to a single general rate of profit which is the average of all these different rates of profit.â€™ Thus he abandoned the labour theory of value stated in the first volume that commodities exchange with one another in proportion to the labour they contain as BÃ¶hm-Bawerk was quick to observe in a famous article in 1896,1

"Genuine question not an argument on right or wrong:\n\nWhen you say you have a conscience and you want whats best for everyone (as in you give a shit about them as the comment above says) but you don't want to be told what to do what happens when a section of the population doesn't have a conscience or doesn't give a shit about the collective? Should they be told what to do?\n\nWhat I'm trying to understand is the boundaries I suppose. As what point should people be told what to do because its necessary for the rest of society? Maybe an example:\n\nIn most developed nations it's generally illegal to dump toxic chemical waste in local drinking water supplies. Now imagine there's a pharmaceutical company with a factory that is dumping their waste into the local water supply. To simplify let's make it a small company with just one director and two hundred workers. The water supply supplies drinking water to the local town with a population of 2000. When questioned the director says that he has the best intentions with this because he's not only creating 200 jobs but he's literally making life saving medication and he'll go bankrupt if he doesn't do as he's been doing. \n\nSo my question is when (if ever) should another power intervene and force the factory shut?\n\nThe example is a hypothetical and probably unrealistic scenario but I'm interested in your political standing on the situation.",2

On *this particular issue* they\'re less in the wrong because they actually did win the election but as a whole they\'re just as bad as Republicans. The thing is nobody wants to acknowledge is that Trump (and the actions of his supporters today) are a symptom of the divide in the country. Trump was unqualified to be president but lots of people supported him *because* he wasn\'t the typical politician. Not because they agreed with him or because they were racists or evil or whatever else Democrats liked to call them but because they saw him as a change from the usual bs of politics. The Democrats vilified anyone who didn\'t outright hate him and the Republicans took full advantage of that. \n\nThe Republicans definitely enabled him but the Democrats made it so easy for them. For four years they constantly insulted his supporters and spread lies about him. Their insistence on turning everything into a Trump scandal made it incredibly easy for his claims of "fake news" to be accepted - because in many cases he was right! After being lied to for so long people started to instinctually not believe anything negative about Trump causing them to give him a pass on the things he actually *did* do wrong.\n\nSo when the election results came in his supporters were already primed to not believe them if they didn\'t go his way. Add onto that his constant insistence that he really did win four years of Democrats claiming 2016 was stolen and even more insults thrown at them and here we are. I highly doubt his supporters would have tried to storm the capitol without his constant claims of the election being stolen but I also doubt they would have cared enough to risk it without the rhetoric of the Democratic Party. \n\ntl:dr both sides bad but Trump is more wrong today,1

> However adopting a child is not covered in this right.\n\nWhy is it not covered in that right or rather why shouldn\'t it be? The main difference between raising a kid via adoption and raising a kid "normally" in practice is whether the kids genetics match your own or you or your partner are the one who directly gave birth to the kid. \n\nBut the actual conditions of "raise a child" aren\'t any different. A heterosexual couple for example might have a kid and then have one or both parents sexually abuse that child and that does in fact happen. Yet society accepts this possibility and gives even terrible parents custody of their kids unless they are caught doing some kind of abuse directly without really having any reasonable standards or screening along the way.\n\nAll of the things you listed for the "right to be a parent" I think could apply to adoption just as much. If you\'re going to say someone who adopts needs to make above a certain amount of money because that means they can properly raise the child - then why should we allow people to raise children who are in poverty in the first place just because they had unprotected sex? Because the alternative is taking away their child? I guess I could see that argument but ultimately I think that the right of the child to have a good upbringing is what is most important.\n\nWhich is a large reason why I oppose discriminating against people in adoption cases when they have no criminal record or reason to think they will be a bad parent as an individual. Because we need more people willing to adopt and the more you shrink that pool of people the more kids are just going to end up being raised in terrible conditions. Trying to "save the children" by discriminating against adopting folks could potentially cause greater harm.\n\n>Maybe we could come to an agreement that if you belong to a group more likely to commit a crime against a child you should have a more in depth screening into the adopters?\n\nI think that\'s a perfectly fair thing to do. Solutions like that which would only help to find any information or details that might slip through the gaps but won\'t stop an actually good parent from adopting are ideal in my books.,6

Stronger income based benefits to buying a first house or getting a secondary education come to mind.,0

I don\'t necessarily think it would be easier to get away with but in the case we are discussing here the fathers likely would have decided to kill their son as they would be afraid of him going to the police and telling them that he had been raped. \n\nIf the choice is between letting the abused child go to the police and tell them what happened at some point or murdering them and disposing of the body I would think that the anxiety produced by the former would lead to much higher outcomes of the latter. Purely because the penalty for both would be death.\n\nThis is the exact reason why no country with English common law has a system where murder is not the highest charge save for high treason which doesn\'t have the same "kill the victim" dilemma about it.\n\nI brought it up in my ethics class today discussing the moral dilemmas that such a system would create. We collectively reached to the conclusion that murder has to be the highest charge for a violent crime based on the reasons listed above.,0

Even in that case I\'d argue that they\'re doing themselfes a disfavour: Slaves need the same "upkeep" (food shelter) a regular worker needs maybe of lesser quality but you also have a giant overhead when it comes to "securing your workforce" (guards etc.) which isn\'t needed in the alternative. No to forget that simply giving someone money and let them take care of the rest (feeding themselves getting shelter etc.) is much more efficient than doing all the logistics as the employer which also naturally offers worse outcome because opportunity costs differ for each individual (=money you spend yourself always offers you a better outcome than the same amount spend by someone else on your behalf).,1

This was a warring continent and when Europeans came the most ruthless tribes not only brought sticks to a gunfight but insisted on having that fight in the first place.

The more peaceful fellas were the ones who didn't face reprisals and constitute the modern native population.\n\nTribes were killing everybody â€“ for millennia â€“ and only stopped when the newcomers came who could defend themselves.",7
Ugh this again.\n\nLemme lay it down for you. The US is by design a nation where a certain religion isnâ€™t supposed to be specifically endorsed or repressed by the Government. If that meets you definition of â€œsecularâ€ than yes the US is supposed to be a secular nation.\n\nHowever many people in the Left seem to think the word secular means â€œatheistic/totally irreligiousâ€ which it doesnâ€™t. The US was conceptualized to nearly all of Founders as being of a Christian stock and it was John Adams who said the Constitution would serve a â€œmoral and Christian people; it will serve no otherâ€.\n\nIn practice this means that the Federal Government cannot create a state religion or suppress any faiths but the people are encouraged to worship God nonetheless. The US was built upon a highly religious foundation they were just wary about enforcing the States control of religion (as they should be) due to their experiences with the British monarchy and the oppression of non-Anglican Christianity. \n\nMany on the Right donâ€™t like when Leftists try to use these principles to try and stomp out religion instead of what they were supposed to do: protect them from the government. Remember the Constitution isnâ€™t a restriction on the people itâ€™s a restriction on the government.,7

The federal government is in a unique position to spend however much it wants on something without being limited by the amount of money it has on hand.

**[Autocracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy#:~:text=Autocracy is a system of or other forms of rebellion)** \n \n >Autocracy is a system of government in which absolute power over a state is concentrated in the hands of one person whose decisions are subject neither to external legal restraints nor to regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d\'Ã©tat or other forms of rebellion). In earlier times the term autocrat was coined as a favorable description of a ruler having some connection to the concept of "lack of conflicts of interests" as well as an indication of grandeur and power. This use of the term continued into modern times as the Russian emperor was styled "Autocrat of all the Russias" as late as the early 20th century.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5),4
Iâ€™m not an acap Iâ€™m a minarchist so I believe there should exist a state only to the extent of enforcing the NAP (court system military law enforcement) so I believe some taxation is necessary but that doesnâ€™t change what it is by its definition which should be a factor considered to keep taxes to a minimum. Additionally I think some taxes should be favored over others that have no consenting basis. Income and property taxes for example are far worse than sales tax imo. \n\n\nAnd a transactional aspect to a robbery doesnâ€™t make it not theft either. If someone robs you for 1000 bucks at gunpoint but also gives you an encyclopedia set that doesnâ€™t make it not theft.,1

What\'s the point them? You want to make a Church and God under your opinion? That\'s kinda prideful and dumb. I mean with all respect imagine reject the church that Christ the apostles and the early fathers established 2000 years ago were they agreed in celibacy just because your thoughts in celibacy are different.

No but your interpretation of the argument is the issue. I made the argument that other races do similar things to demonstrate that most people ARENâ€™T racist pieces of shit. I saw that pointing out of Asians as a specific racist sentiment towards them. Therefor I pushed it to white people as well. YOU interpreted that as me saying â€œwell itâ€™s okay since the white man is worseâ€ when in reality I was saying â€œbeing a racist dick is inherent to one people we all do itâ€. My argument doesnâ€™t condone racism and if you are truly set in the ways that whites arenâ€™t racist (which again I agree since I see no one as inherently racist) then that should mean you agree with my argument on the grounds that it is vile people who are racist and isnâ€™t by race. But no no you had to get defensive. To me it suggests some insecurity some doubts about your own possible racism but I canâ€™t truly say. You interpreted what I said in some twisted way you wanted to hear. You wanted to prove the white mans innocence... for what goal? To make the yellow man look worse? You couldâ€™ve easily argued â€œboth sides have racist people but no ones inherently racistâ€. If you care so deeply about not being racist... why not attack the person making the racist claim about Asians?,6

If Brits were to call inscrutable bankers kikes do to the connection of the stereotype of Jews as inscrutable Bankers 50 years down the line your generations grand children could make the same point you have. The problem is that as a Jewish person my families descendants still very much know that the origin of that term(at contemporary usage 50 year from how) still very much means "person who is sub human and subsequently deserves to be genocided along with the rest of their race". Slurs are a complex linguistic device as they both are directly descriptive while also being performative in the sense that they declare your malice and ill intent. When I have heard someone call me a kike in the past that means to me that I am in great danger and will potienally have the shit beaten out of me.\n\nSo when your descendants use the term to fervently in 50 years my families descendant will rightfully think that someone is about to come and try to beat them to death with a baseball bat. In said instance I would say that your society is racist for allowing this to happen and not fixing the problem but if your grand children did not know they would be fine. Racism is not only defined by intent on a personal level but effect on a societal one.\n\nBut given that you know the real meaning of the g word yet you choose to still use it ya you both live in a racist society and are racist yourself. The origins of that word is clear and even modern 16 year olds know it is a racial slur both in Britain and abroad. So given that if you still chose to do the equivalent of calling all drug dealers the n word you\'re honestly just kind of a shit.,1

"I recognize your points and will give you most of them. I appreciate you taking the time to be charitable to my points and thank you for taking the time to show the nuance for the faith especially the distinctions for the Eucharist Mary as the Mediatrix and the roles in Apostolic succession.\n\nThe one thing I would like to focus on are the examples you gave such as the Divorced Catholics Birth Control or perhaps choosing to practice some forms the faith while maintaining a (perhaps willful) ignorance of others. I want to maintain that these are all (as the Catholic Church teaches) human failings and we are encouraged to move past them. Whether they are or are not actually failings is something that we may or may not agree on but ultimately we are all encouraged to recognize the Catholic Ideal as a sort of source of heat. Nobody is ever going to be perfectly warm but we are encouraged to seek it out and grow warmer in our love of God. \n\nSubsequently I would caution choosing to follow left wing ideologies on the same level of human failings such as birth control or divorce. Ideologies are not just things we do on a day to day basis but ways we ordinance ourselves to the world. It is very difficult to have left wing ideologies not take precedent over God let alone synthesize them with your beliefs. \n\nI feel like we're barking up the same tree but from different angles. Yes I agree that all humans fail. Protestants Catholics Atheists Agnostics and every other faith (or lack of thereof) is constituted of human beings which can and will fail at some point in their lives. I therefore try to judge ideologies not by the humans that follow them but how they compare to the faiths in question.",7

You know how it works: words have a definition but it gets coopted by a certain political side so they can play the motte-and-bailey game: "Equity is about equal outcomes" "How can you be against equity? It\'s just about impartial treatment you monster!"\n\nI take issues with several things about that article. The first is about how the problem is presented: oh look there is this little boy who wants to pick an apple but he can\'t because evil society is skewed against him poor lad! It\'s designed to make the reader sympathetic to him. It wouldn\'t work as well if it showed one boy actively working at picking apples and the other one having a nap instead.\n\nThis brings me to the second issue: the world is complex and solutions trying to grant equal outcomes are only fair in a limited set of situations. Yes there can be cases where society puts arbitrary barriers that make it harder for some people to reach their goals; these cases are worth addressing and removing those needless barriers is a good thing. But mind you this still doesn\'t mean equal outcome it\'s just about giving everyone a fair shot. The argument made by the article goes further.\n\nWhile the tree tipping on one side could be a fault of the system it could as well be just a natural fact. For example if the second boy is simply too short to pick apples from a tree it would be a stretch to say that society should give him a ladder or a ladder that is taller than the one others get. He is not *due* anything except being treated equally; favoring him would mean that others are treated unequally instead. If he is too short maybe he could try picking berries instead of apples and find that he has got an advantage there. Society doesn\'t have infinite resources and what you give to one you are taking away from others; giving unlimited assistance to someone who is dumb as a rock but wants to become a physicist is just a waste; worse still would be taking some reasonable requirements that exist to become a physicist and lowering or removing them so that he can be successful - just apparently because he would still be useless in that sector.\n\nAnd going back to the taking a nap argument the boy who doesn\'t get any apples may just be slacking - which is actually encouraged by a society that follows equity. Is it fair that he gets as many apples as the other boy who spent all day picking them?\n\nThis doesn\'t even take into account the fact that attaining equal outcomes requires cutting the legs of those who perform well because there will always be someone who for any reason just does better than the others. And this applies to every field not just apple picking: is it ok to have an easier time getting a girlfriend because I was born handsome? Is it ok that I keep winning at some sport because I\'ve got talent in that? How do you counter sheer luck? How do you put blind people or children with cancer on par with everyone else? Chasing equity (as equality of outcomes) requires taking more and more tyrannical decisions.,7

That thing that evryone did since history began? \n\n>and Ukraine regions were put on the bottom for the list of "redistribution" meaning they were forced to turn overtheir crops by force much more than other regions in the USSR\n\nyes I know that you just had to read my first comment wiht a little bit more effort: soviet authorities deverted food resources from food-producing regions (Ukraine) to industrial regions they deemed more important. It was fucked up. But don\'t you find it suspicious that these supposed genocidal intentions stopped as soon as the famine stopped?\n\n>THe Khmar Rouge killed a ton of their own race doesn\'t therefore invalidate they did commit a genocide against other races within Cambodia\n\nI have no idea why you bring that up especially considering that Russians and Ukrainians aren\'t (and weren\'t) at all considered two different racial groups. Heck their languages are extremely similar as well. Seriously the imposition of parisian french on the occitan-speaking regions of southern france was more of a linguistic violence than anything the Russians imposed over the Ukrainians. \n\n>Not all genocides are done in name of racial supremacy of those conducting it rather with Communist ones tend to be an ethnicity being especially resistant to its control that causes it.\n\nSuppressing a rebelleus ethnicity isn\'t genocide. Its absurd how among all the fucked up things the soviets did (ethnic relocations of Tartars and Poles for istance) y\'all trying to pass a ill-managed famine as a genocide.,3

A good argument for monarchy is "skin in the game". In a monarchy the longterm interest of the rulers align with the long term interests of the subjects. The better the nation is doing the more powerful the monarch becomes. Therefore he wants his nation to do well. His fate and the rest of his life is bound to the future of his nation if the nation is doing bad so is he. In a democracy this is not the case the only thing politicians have to care about is the next election so they will plot to take more power by any means even if it is bad for the country. For example the massive debt of almost every democratic nation. While making debts is bad for the country it is good for the politician because spending is extremely popular with voters because it gives them money in the short term. For a monarch this is not the case because he knows that the debts won\'t disappear and that he or his children will have to deal with them. \n\nAnother argument is arguing from the iron law of oligarchy. "Regardless of the egalitarian principles they profess human collectives are always ruled by a small minority of leaders who set the important elements of the social and political agenda." In modern democratic society the ruling class aren\'t only the politicians they are acctualy the weakest among the rulers. In democracy the rulers are people with social power those who shape opinions the owners of news cooperations big businesses and actors. They determine the long term societal context in which political opinions are formed and which opinions are outside the social acceptedness. In real monarchies(were the monarch and the nobility acctualy have power so not Britain) the people with power can be identified as such and don\'t rule secretly from the shadows. \n\nMonarchy is the most stable form of government. It has existed for thousands of years. Compared to monarchy all other forms of government were incredibility short lived. And just look at modern democracies how the political discours radicalises itself and becomes extremely toxic. Look at countries like the US how much both sides hate each other and how this makes the country in able to act. Everything becomes politicised. The entire society turns against itself. Democracy is incredibly instable and will not be able to sustain itself for thousands of years as monarchy has. \n\nThere are hundreds more arguments for monarchy but those are a few big ones. If you are interested I can give you a few more arguments and provide you with a few sources. I hope I was able to show you that monachism is a serious political position with political philosophy supporting it and not just European sentimentalusm.,3
well i do agree with every point you\'ve made while those things are "good"(insofar that they are by their nature perpetuating the current exploitative capitalist system) you are correct that they aren\'t socialist concepts technically the sublimation of the concept of the welfare states to socialism is a very weird phenomenon that occurred over the last century or so. but really its the most we can really hope for it seems for america considering the current weird political condition. contradictory ideas are amalgamated to incohesive somewhat counterproductive messes on both sides. but yeah like you said im still gonna support the things that make the most peoples lives better even if its technically wrong,6

In modern TV shows there is typically a team of writers that come up with the plots of all the episodes together (together with the show runners and producers).

The idea with litter is not just to pick up garbage because it is your duty but to make it a bit bigger than it actually is. There are no people who oppose having a cleaner living space. As such the idea of making a communal living space cleaner is an extremely easy sell. So go get your mates pick a place that could use more than just five minutes of work raise a bit of talk local newspapers and bush radios eat this kind of stuff up faster than a starving man and fix it as a community. \n\nThis will be the start of a local community weave from here on go and pick other similar general purpose repairs and work together to fix them. You will find people who are very different from you and you will find they are still people. Homogeny comes from nature but it is only useful when it develops into unity and unity can just as easily be made.\n\nP.s. regarding the "obvious truth" of you having no political power. I have not heard a statement more false and I listen to political adverts! Unless you are actually 13 in which case you still have a good bit of time until you are even meant to have power you should statistically have more power than I do seeing as I am an underage fucktwit living in bumfuck-nowhere the archetype example of a person with no political power. And guess what I have managed to cause change. I have along with three friends managed to force my city government to actually follow through on promises of better youth centers. It was by no means an easy thing it required quite a lot of effort and even more time far more than I feel is reasonable to get the people in power do as they said they would do but we got it done black on white about 300k$ (converting to your currency) in the budget specifically earmarked for this purpose. If four people can do this whilst none of us were old enough to vote what can you do if you get a few more friends together. The true cost to improvement is effort.,6

Applying your subjective perception of the risks of the disease to the whole of society is exactly what pseudoscience is. Defending a mandatory shutdown would literally be the equivalent of me defending the government forcing businesses to stay open. You may as well tell me you know what the price of lithium should be and that individuals can not be trusted to make their own subjective analysis of the value of lithium.\n\nThe idea that a mandatory shutdown is justified because people going about their business are morally culpable for the spread of the disease ignores the fact many more peoples lives are also destroyed by the shutdown of the economy. The point is that it is a cost/benefit calculation that can not be made by any one individual or even a group of scientists trying to make an informed calculation only the subjective voluntary decisions of individuals can come anywhere close to the optimal response for the reasons explained in Hayek\'s lecture. There are those who will selfishly refuse to take measures to slow the spread of the disease but the most you can do is ostracize those who don\'t take the sorts of measures you subjectively determine to be justified. You can not design society around the lowest common denominator without breeding more of that kind of behavior precisely because it teaches people that the consequences of their behavior (good or bad) are not their own. You would not defend the legal concept of a thought-crime in order to prevent murders so why would you defend a mandatory shutdown which presumes knowledge about what would happen if people are given the freedom to make their own judgements. The scientific rationale behind forcing people to shut down their businesses would not stand up in court it presumes to know an impossible amount of information about the costs on every individuals life. This is exactly why politicians are given immunity from liability for the harm their policies create because they presume they are right more often than not and that without this immunity they wouldn\'t have the power to "save society from itself".

Flair up. Also here\'s Scalia\'s full quote (not that he\'s the end-all-be-all interpreter of the Constitution):\n\n\n>Like most rights the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. See e.g. Sheldon in 5 Blume 346; Rawle 123; Pomeroy 152-153; Abbott 333. For example the majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues. See e.g. State v. Chandler 5 La. Ann. at 489-490; Nunn v. State 1 Ga. at 251; see generally 2 Kent *340 n. 2; The American Students\' Blackstone 84 n. 11 (G. Chase ed. 1884). Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession *2817 of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.[26]\n\n>We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. Miller said as we have explained that the sorts of weapons protected were those "in common use at the time." 307 U.S. at 179 59 S.Ct. 816. We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of "dangerous and unusual weapons." See 4 Blackstone 148-149 (1769); 3 B. Wilson Works of the Honourable James Wilson 79 (1804); J. Dunlap The New-York Justice 8 (1815); C. Humphreys A Compendium of the Common Law in Force in Kentucky 482 (1822); 1 W. Russell A Treatise on Crimes and Indictable Misdemeanors 271-272 (1831); H. Stephen Summary of the Criminal Law 48 (1840); E. Lewis An Abridgment of the Criminal Law of the United States 64 (1847); F. Wharton A Treatise on the Criminal Law of the United States 726 (1852). See also State v. Langford 10 N.C. 381 383-384 (1824); O\'Neill v. State 16 Ala. 65 67 (1849); English v. State 35 Tex. 473 476 (1871); State v. Lanier 71 N.C. 288 289 (1874).\n\n>It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military serviceâ€”M-16 rifles and the likeâ€”may be banned then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause. But as we have said the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\'s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia to be as effective as militias in the 18th century would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large. Indeed it may be true that no amount of small arms could be useful against modern-day bombers and tanks. But the fact that modern developments have limited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right.,3

Because they still kill people who donâ€™t run. Watch the first part of the footage he was literally trying to comply and trying to de-escalate but they kept screaming contradictory orders (â€œget on the groundâ€ while he was literally on the ground or â€œlay on your stomachâ€ while simultaneously restraining him from moving) and threatening to break his arms and shit when he was literally trying to tell them to calm down and that he was trying to comply. Which by the way the responsibility of attempting de-escalation should not fall on the person being detained by the police it should be the police trying to calm the situation down.\n\nSo after going through all that itâ€™s pretty understandable why someone would choose to run.\n\nTLDR: just watch the footage and youâ€™d see why someone would rather just try to run.

I\'ve a Chinese friend and when we were in Malaysia we went to some Chinese restaurants and he\'d often comment on the people saying things like "They\'re from the south. You can tell because they look like fish." and then saying people from the north looked like horses. I asked what people from the centre looked like (where he\'s from) and he said they\'re the only normal ones.\n\nHe didn\'t seem like a bad guy it just seemed like this is what he\'d been told his whole life. Like he was just completely ignorant of so many things. He\'d usually be fairly accepting of new things even if his existing views seemed close-minded.\n\nI like to think that travelling with me opened his eyes somewhat but I don\'t know. He had other things going on that were more important to him. Plus I probably had my own ideas and biases that aren\'t strictly more correct.\n\nAlthough he used to joke *"The best thing about China is we have no religion so we eat everything. The worst thing about China is we have no religion so we\'re horrible."*,4

A lot of the responses that Iâ€™ve seen here are devoid of any empathy. It makes me sad. And if people want to harp on him for fleeing whatâ€™s the message theyâ€™re trying to send then? â€œDonâ€™t flee from police because they might beat you to death when they catch youâ€? I canâ€™t wrap my head around it. And then they hand wave away what the cops did. â€œObviously what they did was bad and they should go to jail BUT it ONLY happened because he fledâ€. Like they ignore all other context surrounding the traffic stop like how the cops escalated it for no reason. Or how Nichols wasnâ€™t fighting back he was only tensed up on the ground and spoke calmly the whole time. And then they say almost nothing about the part where he was fucking beaten to death while his hands were restrained. One cop did a run up kick to his face while he was restrained he was beaten with a baton so bad his kidneys ruptured and it killed him and people want to talk about how he resisted arrest and ran away at the first traffic stop.\n\nIâ€™m glad thereâ€™s at least some people here that have basic human decency.,1

There are also accounts from Soviet soldiers though from 39-41 mostly as well as accounts from American soldiers who were behind Russian lines in 1919.  The nazi accounts that were taken were mostly taken when they were driving the soviets back in the early 40s and there are also Finnish accounts. Maybe the disparity comes from differences in the definition of a human wave. The red army didnâ€™t have much heavy arms compared to the Germans so their army was largely infantry with little to no tank cavalry artillery and air support. In that scenario thereâ€™s not many other strategies that utilize an army of size guerilla tactics and shoot and move work in that case but are very hard to manage as a general human wave takes little organization at scale. If you define the human wave as a large mass of infantry tightly packed with little cover from trenches and tanks they certainly used the human wave. Thereâ€™s actually pictures and video that show it in action as well.,1

There are things which you can keep private like your sexuality or a secret or a guilty pleasure. You have no right to privacy when it comes to taking a human life. It is the duty of a civilized society to protect each other but especially the young. For 99% of abortions it's about convenience and that's evil.

"I'm LibCenter but slightly right leaning. I think the role of government is to protect our rights. Ideally the government strips the fewest rights away from people as possible while best preventing people from infringing on each other's rights which includes property rights. To me that's a very classical liberal way of thinking in the spirit of John Locke but it seems like most people who identify as classical liberals and libertarians don't operate with that way of thinking. I also fully support a social contract as long as it's voluntary. That might seem like a contradiction but I believe that as long as the government has the consent of those it governs (in other words the country is an effective democracy) that makes the social contract voluntary. This is why my number 1 issue is voting reform because I think our voting system (US here) is incredibly poor at translating public opinion into policy making the social contract unethical IMO.\n\nSorry for wall of text",8

And individual should feel discomfort guilt anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race color sex or national origin.\n\nBasically if you tell people in mandatory trainings where your employment is possibly at stake that they should feel bad on account of their race or sex then that is discrimination.

Its just also about ensuring that the people have a safety net of coverage that ensures them basic human necessities like food Healthcare and shelter/rent. \n\nYou provide everyone with the basic means of comfortable living and then every cent they make becomes disposable income they can spend on luxury products and services to make them happy rather than being required to spend it on necessities to ensure their survival.

I last upgraded my phone in 2021 for the 5G and won\'t be changing ever until it literally dies last phone before that was made in 2010. I tip my Uber drivers because I order food once a month and it\'s not a big ask. The only consoomer behaviour I partake in is smoking and Marlboros are expensive precisely because they use Virginia tobacco grown "ethically" with local workers.\n\nContrast with the poorest of the Emily\'s who refuse to live frugally and waste regardless of means or the richest of the Emily\'s; Hasan Piker\'s take-out bill every week is more than most family\'s monthly rent. \n\nMust consoom Ben and Jerry\'s must consoom Funk Pops must consoom new iPhone must consoom new MacBook must consoom 12 hours of Twitter everyday using up 90% of my electricity must consoom $15 Juul pod made in China by slave labour must consoom consoom **CONSOOM**.,1
"Then I really don't see what the article did or said that was wrong. It actually struck me as a fairly thoughtful piece on the complexity of working out your own identity. I'm not sure what is really wrong with adolscents exploring identities that they may not stick with later in life when they have more fully developed.\n\nThat said the detransition numbers are incredibly low. About 2-3% iirc so the stats really don't work in your favour unless you're referencing something I'm unaware of.\n\nI really don't think that there's a hard and fast rule between overly controlling and abandonment. Both are incredibly damaging and the impact varies from person to person. I'm not sure complete control can ever be non-abusive.",6

â€œRich white maleâ€ is a recurring joke?  You mean like â€œstupid fucking white man?â€  You know what â€œrich white maleâ€ is in 2023?

Ideally it needed counter revolution not revolution with the heroism of the vendee and Bretagne being entirely lacking in the corrupted court of Versailles. The trouble was centralisation and the ideological undermining of throne and altar by liberalism created the mess that the revolutionaries exploited and maurras makes the point something along the lines that France was lost when Rousseau started being read and his ideas entertained in Versailles.,3

"Well systems spread across virtually every society to ever exist all over the planet since the dawn of time would indicate that no it can't be truly equal.

And until AI runs everything there never will be. \n\nIt's like communism utopian true equality may seem nice in theory but it just won't work. The Nordic countries proved it they have the most egalitarian laws in the world and men and women responded naturally by settling into traditional gender roles and women chose jobs traditionally dominated by females and men jobs dominated by males at a higher rate than the rest of the western world. \n\nWhen given the most freedom ever to choose their path men and women enjoy the traditional ways.

I know because of your ideology you donâ€™t consider it a violation of human rights but I certainly do along with millions of other Americans.

A baby coming into existence by being placed in a womb as the direct result of the actions between two consenting adults through no fault of its own does not constitute any punishment of the baby let alone the same level of punishment as sayâ€¦serial killings. You canâ€™t kidnap someone drag them into your house and kill them for trespassing before they regain consciousness. Thatâ€™s premeditated murder.,1

> Exactly it refers to gender. That\'s what I said.\n\nIt refers to sex.\n\n> It is when the only thing that makes you a woman is what gender you identify as not what\'s between your legs.  \n\nThe only thing that makes you a woman is your biological sex which cannot be changed.   \n\n> then why shouldn\'t we respect their decision to identify as a woman?  \n\nBecause they aren\'t a woman. To use the old attack helicopter meme: If i want to larp as Napoleon and identify as Napoleon would you respect my decision to identify as Napelon and refer to me as Emperor in a serious manner? It\'s really the same level of ridiculous.

Woman refers to adult human female (biological sex). Many of them also believe that men should be able to compete in women\'s sports and be able to freely enter women\'s bathrooms and other things that are supposed to be only for women. If they were just like "yeah i\'m a dude that likes to dress like a woman" then i\'d be like "okay you do you weirdo" but they want to bend reality and have society conform to their mental illness which is not acceptable.\n\n> Because I want to see you publicly own up \n\nI already told you that races are not equal in "public". Skeletal structure brain structure and volume muscle fiber types lung capacity liability to certain diseases and so on. But surely you already know all of this so I\'m interested in why you think races are equal despite all the differences that lead to vastly different outcomes depending on the situation. If a population is better at performing certain tasks then there is no equality and we know for a fact that some groups of people are inherently better at certain tasks.,4

That is a real equation promoted by a large portion of academia.

Good point. \n \nSo I guess if owning the F-22 jet isnâ€™t an issue the discussion would more revolve around owning the bombs and missiles that the platform can fire (similar to the tank with the gun being the issue; essentially without it we just have a really heavy tractor).\n \nThe F22 (or anything similar) is a single operated vehicle with weapons that can be fired by that operator. It kind of falls into that definition that u/trapsinplace was angling at in the comment above.\n \nI can see where you are coming from regarding man-portable but again I think that is a tricky definition.

Yes because the hedge funds that are about to die are holding a gun to the rest of the market. \n\nFrom my VERY limited understanding when the "short squeeze" happens the brokers of these companies basically decide that "no you lost" and will do everything they can to recover the short stocks that they have to give back. This means that they\'ll pay any price the stock has on the market to buy it back. Literally any price. This means we may very well see a single GME share get sold for like $10\'000 in the squeeze or a lot more even. \n\nHere\'s the thing though. These companies literally don\'t have enough money to do that so the brokers will start liquidating all their other stocks to pay for the GME stocks they have to buy. This means mass sell offs of stocks in all the other stocks probably specially the very stable ones. This means the rest of the market goes down which could trigger a panic and a subsequent crash. \n\nYes the stock market might crash because these greedy cunts didn\'t want to confess to defeat earlier and decided to go all in and double down on their position. And people are already in a shitty economic position so they wouldn\'t really care of Wallstreet burned down and hell some might even cheer. \n\nSo if there\'s no bailout or government intervention Wallstreet might crash. Or at the very least that\'s probably the direction it will be spun when these leeches come to the government asking for help. \n\nUnfortunately for them right now there\'s bipartisan sentiment against them because they\'ve engaged in market manipulation so while there might be a bailout it probably won\'t be an 08 style bailout and more like "ok let\'s print money into the market and pay all the GME holders so the economy won\'t implode. No you don\'t get to runaway and go anywhere else. You just made the government pay out the ass to a bunch of reddit nerds so you\'ll now get bankrupt and the whole activity of shorting will get heavily regulated and everyone involved will get investigated for market manipulation."\n\nRemember history (and most if not all law) is written by the victor. In 08 nothing happened because the fucks were rich after they broke the world economy. This time they lost a shit ton of money while breaking the US economy. This time they won\'t be the victors. \n\nDisclaimer: this is not financial advice. I am dumb. This is all probably wrong.,2

But most people do whatever is fastest and easiest. \n\n> Public transit is largely the domain of the working poor the elderly students and the homeless. \n\nIn the US yes because we've spent 70 years destroying all of our cities and making it *required* to have a car. \n\n> No it really doesn't. \n\nIt really does this is [fairly basic and well-known fact](https://www.transformative-mobility.org/assets/publications/Passenger-Capacity-of-different-Transport-Modes_2021-09-08-071924_mmuh.pdf).

Eh. I\'d say going cover to cover is one of the worst ways to read the Bible.\n\nI\'ve gone through the new testament and gone from genesis through numbers before tapping out since the OT is literally 4x longer than the NT.\n\nWhat you really want to do is figure out why you\'re reading the Bible in the first place and build a game plan off of that.  \n\nSeems like a lot of people attempt it just so they can wear a pin saying "I read the bible" but they treat it like it\'s marathon rather than a holy book.\n\nIf you want to understand Jesus you can read one of the gospels as your primary source and go into the details and background as you read each section.  For instance most people don\'t seem to catch on that the sermon on the mount is an interpretation of existing Jewish law which you could reference the original commands for by jumping back and forth.\n\nIf you want to understand the early church then the epistles and acts are great.\n\nEven better yet do it side by side with analysis from experts.\n\nWhich is not to mention that there is no way a typical person will retain 1600 pages of information and be able to apply and recall it.\n\nThere are a lot of different goals that are possible and I think any expectation of going cover to cover for credential purposes is mistaken.,0

Iâ€™d say a bigger thing is just building our communities to be walkable so people get exercise without thinking about it.

That attitude became ingrained in American society which became US culture which grew into legislation and attitudes that still govern our daily lives.\n\nAsian people had it bad.

People really need to stop spreading that statistic; it doesn\'t mean anything close to what it sounds like. The Carbon Majors Report says that 100 public and private fossil fuel companies "account for" for 71% of industrial (not total) CO2 emissions since 1988. But their calculation of "accounting" is arrived at by treating the emissions from all use of fossil fuels as attributable to the company that originally extracted them. That is to say when I burn a gallon of gas driving around the emissions from that gallon are assigned to Exxon (or whoever) pumped it from the earth. \n\nIn other words what that stat really says is that the top 100 companies (most of which are government or quasi-government entities like Sinopec or Saudi Aramco or Statoil) produce 71% of oil extraction. It\'s dishonest to say they are responsible for the emissions. I\'m responsible for the gasoline I burn in my car not Exxon Mobil or Chevron or whoever was the one that pumped it out of the ground. And because most of the companies are government entities all or most of their revenue goes to government coffers anyway and saying to \'tax them\' really changes very little. \n\nThe statistic\'s only real information is telling us that the top 100 companies are responsible for 71% of extraction. If I were a cynical person I would suggest that the report was deliberately written and designed to be misinterpreted in exactly the way it has been.,1

The "trade war" with China that was going to ruin the economy not only DIDNT ruin it it was also necessary. China has abused global trade for years and it had to be stopped. \n\nhttps://www.industryweek.com/the-economy/trade/article/21974236/it-is-time-to-stand-up-to-china\n\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/874ff152-73a5-11e8-bab2-43bd4ae655dd\n\n\n\nChina treated itself as a third-world country when it suited them.

"I've heard him talk he can only convince you on immigration if you don't try to think of a solution that isn't closing borders. The only way immigration hurts workers is if A. you have capitalism AND B. the supply of jobs can't meet demand for jobs. A leftist wants to get rid of capitalism which therefore eliminates all economic disadvantages of immigration. Also even if you keep capitalism reason B is only ever true in strong recessions otherwise immigrants both create jobs by starting businesses as well as filling the labor need that is lacking say jobs citizens won't do or simply facilitating the creation of start ups by increasing the labor supply. \n\nThe line of thinking that is anti-immigrant for economic reasons (which generally doesn't have any validity except for the narrow cases strong recessions) would also be anti-natalist fully or partially given that if you have more kids you're increasing the labor supply therefore increasing competition and decreasing wages. Most if not nearly all anti-immigrants are not anti-natalist.  \n\nThe vast majority of anti-immigrant sentiment is held for racial reasons if you dig even a little bit. Economic reasons are used just because it's generally accepted that explicit racism is wrong. Especially with Tucker Carlson so while it's great he's talking about class (though his critiques are kept within acceptable limits that don't endanger the elites.) he is still a white nationalist (practically a white supremacist the distinction has no material difference only theoretical).",2

If a refugee goes to an access point you can apply to be a refugee there at which point we will go through the process of determining weather the claim is legitimate as we do for the thousands of refugees that enter the US. The only hypocrisy is i you decide to disingenuously propose that illegal aliens are all refugees which is simply false particularly when you remember that the commitment the US made was only to protect those who were fleeing persecution from their home state only which does not include those fleeing from civil wars (unless one or more parties of the war are targeting the individual in question) or those fleeing from poor economic conditions.\n\nin fact when you remember that the US has historically been far more generous than it has needed to be by law or by commitment including most refugees from the middle east crisis who by in large were not political asylum seekers but people displaced by war who the US made no agreement to protect.",1

All of those things are good and what should be taught. I am glad your school is doing it right. There are headlines from schools that arenâ€™t and theyâ€™re the ones going after.

"I agree I did use a lot of speculation about what the founding fathers would and wouldn't think of modern firearms but I also had two different interpretations of how the second amendment has written could be used in the baning of firearms.\n\nFirst interpretation\nSince a militia is no longer required for the security of the United states. The second of amendment is null and void so the government can do whatever it wants in regards to firearms.\n\nSecond interpretation\nThe government cannot prevent people from owning arms that would allow them to act in the role of a militiamen which is a relatively narrow slice of firearms.  However this does not mean they cannot require universal background checks waiting periods and suitable gun storage laws as these control laws do not prevent anyone from becoming a militia man.",0

Nice rebuttal. You really showed me how my take was incorrect by calling me names.  \n\nNobody is turning it around.  I just got done spelling out how that isnâ€™t even possible in half a dozen ways.\n\nLike you directly quoted some of my points and then instead of spelling out how they are wrong which should be easy if they are so clownish you just had a little baby hissy fit instead.\n\nWillfully blind my ass.  I am white I encounter no discrimination I encounter no systemic injustices.  I see how you guys try to portray things with your cherry-picked out of context quotes from social media and then I see my actual lived experience and what goes on in the world around me and they donâ€™t match.   Your selective one-sided portrayal alone calls you out.  I give you guys a chance again and again to make a coherent case but itâ€™s just always this exact same shit every time.  \n\nUntil you can actually state the other sideâ€™s position accurately you are not making a rebuttal. I say this as the center judging both of your positions.\n\nThis actually brings me to the final reason your movement doesnâ€™t convince me of anything.  You canâ€™t make a real argument and you just fall into name calling and evasion when your shallow talking points are challenged in any substantial way.,8

I donâ€™t understand how anyone even supports Biden. What has he done to help this country? The only reason 99% of America knows who he is is because heâ€™s just â€œthat guy who ran next to the black guy.â€ \n\nTrump is not exactly the greatest example of filtering oneself but Joe Biden makes Trump look SMART. Trump says one stupid thing every couple of weeks Joe Biden does this every single day at this point. People will only vote for Joe Biden because they donâ€™t want to vote for Donald Trump. \n\nBiden might actually end up having even less POC turn out for him than Clinton. As long as he keeps up his racially insensitive language heâ€™s going to have record low numbers in black voters. He *NEEDS* these voters if he wants a chance against Trump.\n\nâ€œPoor kids are just as talented as white kidsâ€\n\nâ€œIf you canâ€™t decide if youâ€™re with me or Trump youâ€™re not black.â€\n\nAll the Trump campaign needs to do is run ads with these quotes in POC-majority areas. They might not flip to Trump but they certainly will think twice before voting for Joe Biden.\n\nNot to mention that the Bernie bros are literally trying to play spoiler in this election. Theyâ€™re attacking Biden just as much as the Republicans. The Democrats will NOT win in November with a base splintered this badly. Meanwhile Republicans have solidified their support for Trump with >95% approval in the Republican Party. I wonder what Joe Bidenâ€™s is in the Democratic Party? 40%? 50%? \n\nEven with the corona virus pandemic the Democrats arenâ€™t even able to deny the fact that the Trump administration produced incredible results for the economy and foreign affairs.

Copied from someone elseâ€™s comment:\n\nhttps://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/01/16/idaho-senate-committee-advances-bill-that-would-change-legal-definition-of-abortion/\n\nWintrow asked Herndon if the bill would force a hypothetical 13-year-old girl who was raped by a male family member to carry the child to term. Herndon said the state of Idaho has nothing to do with forcing anyone to carry a child and those are merely natural circumstances.\n\nâ€œSome people could describe the situation that youâ€™re talking about as the opportunity to have a child in those terrible circumstances if the rape actually occurred â€ Herndon told Wintrow. He told the story of a person in Montana who wrote a book about how her stepfather raped her and forced her to have an abortion the first time she was pregnant and the second time she had the child.\n\nâ€œThat child that she actually had proved to be incredibly cathartic for her and a huge blessing in her life â€ he said.\n\nSo he was calling carrying the pregnancy to term natural not familial rape and was referencing a specific womanâ€™s experience when saying the child could possibly be cathartic.,7

This doesn't mean they wouldn't rather be doing infrastructure projects. They just can't.\n\nEven disregarding that there is this blind adherence to anyone who has any kind of expertise. Fed economists are not perfect people. They are fallible and will by the nature of how they got to their position be accepting of the current thought paradigm and the opinions of other elites. In our day and age that inevitably leads to a focus on the problems of the wealthy and powerful and a disregard for everyone else.\n\nMost leftists know this and throw any Fed policy through a healthy dose of skepticism.

Wind and solar simply aren\'t reliable enough in this region the Mississippi river is too wild and unpredictable for hydro but could be used to cool a nuclear plant. )\n\nThey are definitely biased but they do sometimes make decent points about some things.

They built a bunch of multi-million dollar houses the hotel prices sky-rocketed and the places where the locals used to rent evicted them so that the landlords could rent to the above mentioned people. \n\nBy now things are so bad that the remaining local families have to make monthly trips to the country\'s capital to buy groceries because in the local supermarkets the prices are 60% higher. \nGentrification really sucks.,7
What did Kansas do so terribly different pre tax cuts?\n\nWhat challenges did they face that ALL neighboring states did not?\n\nWhy is the assumption that the tax cuts have no effect on the economy?\n\nYou have started with a conclusion: Tax cuts can do no wrong. And are working backwards to try and force and fit everything to support that narrative. Tax cuts arent the be all end all but there are plenty who think that trickling down and removing taxes from businesses would give the economy all the power it needs to move ahead. The Kansas experiment suggests otherwise. With no obvious other issue that separates Kansas out. It very much likely is the tax cuts at play.,6
Do you realize over 50% of Muslims IN THE UK I REPEAT THE UK A WESTERN "CIVILISED" COUNTRY" want homosexuality to be illegal? What do you think the number is in the rest of the world? The non-western non-secular world? Get out of your own bubble for once in a while for fuck sake.,3
Upvote for paragraphs 2 3\n\nMaybe upvote for 1 if you just meant that\'s what the other dude meant rather than saying Trump surrounded himself with Fuentes purposefully (Ye brought him along)\n\nDownvote for 4\n\nWhat institution in the U.S. actually deserved trust?\nHe exposed the Media Industrial Complex for what it is "Fake News"\n\nMisinformation? Election fraud like Venezuelan/German servers yeah. \nHe didnt argue on the correct route of the election wasn\'t free and fair due to illegal/unconstitutional rule changes for voting in many states. (Wisconsin and Pennsylvania had rulings against drop boxes and mail in voting respectively after 2020)\n\nStop voting? Yeah idk probably a bad thing to say. But definitely was some sketchy stuff like in Georgia shutting down a whole voting center cause of a leaky toilet lol.\n\nFairly certain it\'s constitutionally viable for Pence to reject some of the electors if he wanted to.\n\nSpent a bit researching it again. https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/01/04/pence-1887-electoral-vote-count-act-trump-biden/\n\nElectoral Count Act of 1887: Following the precedents of 1857 the act bars the vice president from ***arbitrarily*** deciding to reject state votes. If there are any valid objections the House and Senate withdraw to confer separately. Objections must be stated in writing in advance and signed by at least one member of both the House and Senate.\n\nBased on all the shenanigans that year a few states definitely wouldn\'t have been arbitrary.,4

Assuming "not going through male puberty" makes you 100% woman physiologically (which it doesn\'t) how\'s that happening then? A kid at age of like 11 decides that he is a woman and starts injecting himself with Estrogen? How does that sound sane to you? It\'s a fucking kid are you really into indoctrination of kids about gender bending since their gain of consciousness? Are you really the starwman this sub makes you?,1
"Is there any research into the suicide rate of people who want to transition but don't do it for whatever reason? Because if the suicide rate drops from say a theoretical 60% to the 50% you mentioned (other comments say it's more like 41%) then I would argue that it doesn't not work. That being said I would still think that there should be more research done and hopefully some less invasive and more effective methods found.  \n  \nThe way I see it transitioning as a way of curing gender dysphoria is somewhat similar to a doing a lobotomy to cure PTSD: yes at the time of invention it seems reasonable. But hopefully we can destigmatize the problem to the point where meaningful research can help us (and the mentally ill) find better solutions.",4

"You realize corporations don't care about their employees or worker rights they care about money.\n\nThey're doing this because an abortion is far cheaper than paying out for family planning not because they genuinely want to help people.\n\nThis is fairly dangerous because it gives corporations even more power over people and screws over small businesses and independent workers because some halfwit politician decided to make dumb laws no doubt backed by these same corporations.\n\nThis is why health insurance should be untied from employment along with all the special tax breaks.\n\nIt's cool that there's still 0 required days of paid leave.",8
Yeah youâ€™re right. Thereâ€™s the wish to have a greater separation between the races a belief that one should cough up a fine of 100 000 dollars for wrong pronoun use and harassing into leaving the internet or joblessness people who have different political opinions and calling it social consequences. \n\nAnd THEN saying that when a feminist is harassed or booted online those social consequences donâ€™t apply to her. AND pretending like a rich woman is more oppressed than a poor man. Youâ€™re right there IS a lot more to modern day feminism.,0

Wouldn\'t it stand to reason that an isolated ethnostate that hasn\'t interacted with the world in an enriching way would end up being paranoid about people living in society backwards and left behind in enlightenment for they haven\'t sought out new thought (if only to galvanize their held beliefs) and generally have an outdated and myopic view of the world at large? How would an authright ethnostate even evolve with technology or communicate effectively with other countries? Human progress historically is made when we interact and progress with other cultures and countries. I\'m trying to think of a successful ethnostate that wasn\'t a puppet dictatorship. The problem with ethnostate is that you run out of minorities to oppress so the country implodes because you start oppressing "regular citizens",6

Like you're saying they don't exist at all or that you don't accept them in their preferred gender?\n\nCause I mean it's fine if you just don't accept them but it's very obvious that there is a number of people who have and continue to undergo physical medical and superficial transformation to emulate the opposite sex. Like I don't think you can debate that. Whether or not they *should* isn't really relevant to the conversation though. If you don't want to call them trans then I suppose we'll have to just come up with a new term for them. Any suggestions?\n\n\n\n>Nice rant about conservatives.

Youâ€™re right. We donâ€™t know. It could even be the case that the poor kid did a prep course and the rich one didnâ€™t. But we can draw inferences from what we do know.

"> And while nutrition lack of education and resources do play a factor it's been proven that a large portion of it is hereditary/genetic\n\nEver heard of the flynn effect? Between 1970-1990 south korea on average [put on 16 IQ points](http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/nijenhuis2011ip_FE_Korea.pdf). Obviously not a genetic change.

Nutrition in particular plays a huge role\n\n> For example Aborigines have an IQ average 10-20 points less than Native Americans given similar treatment and living situations. \n\nâ€œSimilar treatment and living conditionsâ€...iâ€™d argue that this point is nullified by their VASTLY different histories and historical treatments\n\nEven if the aborigines and native Americans were scientifically controlled for all possible external factors and it turns out the aborigines are dumber...this doesnâ€™t PROVE your claim.

Furthermore the people are compelled into **extremely** rigorous education which lowers QoL but increases IQ.\n\nIâ€™m not saying that youâ€™re 100% wrong. Iâ€™m not even close to having the burden of proof for this claim. However you are also not even close to the burden of proof for your claim. Whatâ€™s this â€œburden of proofâ€ you ask? Knowledge of how genetic codes translate to intelligence. Being able to pick out certain base pairs on a genome and say â€œthis is why youâ€™re dumb/smartâ€.

Agree. Although as I mentioned some of the things you suggest are not without their risks too. \n \n*Good quality* kibble is critical. I think that a lot of modern health problems (thinking teeth gums skin etc.) in dogs come from feeding the cheapest food available with high amounts of salt (salt being palatable makes the dog like it so owner keeps purchasing). There will always be scummy humans trying to profit off ignorance and marketing. Again that nuance and complication.\n \nItâ€™s got to be a balance of everything but actual cooked meat along with a lot of the other things you originally mentioned is always going to be better than biscuits alone. I supplement meals with some reputable biscuits which seems to be working quite well for her. \n \nI completely understand that most dog owners are not in a position to harvest their own meat so I can see why you would suggest a pure kibble diet for them.\n \nGotta love this sub and the logical discussions that we can have.,4

Hey did you know that in terms of male human and female PokÃ©mon breeding Vaporeon is actually not the most compatible PokÃ©mon for humans? This is a common and understandable misconception however Vaporeon has it\'s human on PokÃ©mon breedability outclassed by it\'s cousin evolution Umbreon. Umbreon weights approximately 60 pounds or around 27 kilograms and is 3\'3" tall (About a meter) making it not only large enough to appropriately handle human genitalia but also light enough to easily be lifted and promptly set back down repeatedly. It\'s relatively small size would also prove a tight entry which is always a good thing. Umbreon also boasts an extremely impressive defensive stat spread. With it\'s combination of very high HP Defense and Special Defense stats it can take a great pounding and come back for more! It\'s ability Inner Focus allows it to keep slamming attentively without getting fatigued. Umbreon also has access to the ability Synchronize which allows it to share it\'s current status with you meaning you will receive all of the pleasure it feels COMBINED with all the pleasure you\'re getting from pounding this perfect breedable PokÃ©mon. Umbreon also has the capability of seeing perfectly in pitch-black darkness allowing it to effectively attend a midnight fornication session. Even if you do manage to drain Umbreon\'s energy with all the furious thrusts it can recover very quickly with its access to the move Moonlight. Its black fur is also a giant positive attribute allowing all the excretions you make to be easily seen all over its body. A great fun fact Umbreon can excrete toxins in its sweat which would in turn soak into your member and swell it up making it even more sizable and sensitive. This would not only enhance the experience for you but for your Umbreon as well (Which with Synchronize ends up pleasing you exponentially more). Umbreon\'s wide movepool also supports the hypothesis that Umbreon is the best PokÃ©mon to breed with. It can learn Payback which doubles in power after the PokÃ©mon is hit meaning Umbreon with throw it back twice as hard as normally if you\'re hitting it good. Umbreon can also learn Guard Swap; it could give YOU its insane durability and go crazy on you all night with your now massive endurance. Speaking of endurance Umbreon also has access to Endure making it practically immune to fatigue it will always have energy left over. Charm is also within Umbreon\'s movepool letting it be extremely seductive towards you easily getting you in the mood. Umbreon can also use Taunt in turn making you ONLY able to to attacking moves such as Slam Pound etc; none of that foreplay shit right into the action. It also has access to Sleep Talk giving it the ability to not only give consent in its sleep allowing access to any of its ports and any time but also move in it\'s sleep making it an effective 24/7 fuckmate. Umbreon still has even more great moves that good to have while smashing such as Quick Attack allowing swift slams and bounces which can have even greater power if Umbreon uses Curse beforehand. Curse would also raise Umbreon\'s defense making it able to take powerful thrusting for almost any duration. Looking back Umbreon\'s slightly small size ensures a gorilla grip cavity and easy physical manipulation. Its ungodly bulk allows it to take poundings for hours on end and resume after recovering with moonlight (Which works even better when it\'s sunny). It\'s access to the abilities Inner Focus and Synchronize allow it to unwaveringly throw it back and add all of its pleasure onto yours effectively making it twice as amazing as any other PokÃ©mon or even FOUR TIMES factoring in the doubled power of payback of course. All of this information in combination with its extremely useful movepool in the world of intercourse makes Umbreon the PokÃ©mon most qualified to breed with humans; able to take dick of any shape any size in any position easily for extensive periods of time while having the ability to return for even more mere seconds later.,0

Thatâ€™s where weâ€™re losing each other. Youâ€™re talking about hypotheticals while Iâ€™m talking about reality. The statement to which you object has real-world context and implications. So to analyze that line of thinking in a vacuum doesnâ€™t make sense. It allows you to warp the meaning of that statement altogether. For instance it is irrational for a poor person to vote to further enrich the wealthy. The poor person should vote for which party represents their interest best. We are not able to vote on individual issues so to try and hold that original statement to such strict standards is a misrepresentation of *reality.* \n\nYouâ€™re trying to construct an argument with strict but unrealistic conditions in order to force a desired outcome,0

Skin color and gender do play minor roles but when statisticians/economists factor in every variable to the best of human ability we find both play very minor roles.

I suppose it would be the way they go about it or motivations for it. Franco and Gaddafiâ€™s were grounded in religion whereas Hitlerâ€™s was very much secular. Franco also was isolationist in the terms of warfare. He didnâ€™t care about cleansing Europe like hitler did he quite honestly just wanted to restore the spanish empire as during the time when he was vying for power spain was a shell of its former self. Itâ€™s a multifaceted dynamic for sure. Youâ€™ll find that it â€œrhymesâ€ more than it being 100% different or similar but itâ€™s interesting how cultural aspects can affect the way different ideologies are employed. To summarize Francoâ€™s motivations were to restore the monarchy and restore Spain as a Catholic society. Hitlerâ€™s was to cleanse Europe to creat his own ideal society.,4

But I\'m never going to give up on that and the opposing side seems to not want to give up on helping people based on race first and economic need later and the result is that nobody gets help - like this is all planned so economically things are not progressing.,4

">When screening large numbers of applications people use limited information that they have in lieu of having more detailed information about the individuals that apply which inevitably results in large sweeping judgements being made without considering the merits of the individual.

Creating an unfriendly culture and one that clearly limits outsiders subversively is racism. \n\nWhat isn't constructive is to pretend that this doesn't exist when it objectively does. What is constructive is to acknowledge that fact and work to fight it. That's what education is reminders and understanding.

>they are not intrinsic unavoidable feature\n\nThey absolutely are or it wouldn\'t be happening. Slavery didn\'t go away in the us without a war and still exists elsewhere in the world. If you have to regulate the owning of humans then it is an unavoidable feature. That\'s the main downside with capitalism. If people are fair and kind capitalism is a great system. But when people are cruel and exploitative then it runs into issues like child labour slave labour etc. \n\n>has decided that that\'s the best possible option for themselves over working in the rice fields or whatever other industry there is in Vietnam. \n\nYou clearly have no understanding of these countries if you think thats just a viable option. Also nobody is forcing Apple or Samsung to make their products there. They are circumventing labour laws in their own country by going to third world countries. Also by funding practices that pay employees so poorly they reinforce it so that it lasts. Why would countries like Vietnam introduce new labour laws if all these tech companies are giving them so much business? \n\n>Someone is "worth" whatever it is someone else is willing to give them for performing whatever labor\n\nIm glad you put that in quotes because even you know that\'s a horseshit explaination. Teachers are woefully underpaid they are worth more. Those people making the phones are underpaid. Explioting people who don\'t have the power to fight back is not the same as determining their worth. You\'re right they don\'t *have* to make phones for 2c an hour. They can instead go across the street and make clothing for 3c an hour. Now that\'s what I call a competitive market! \n\n>some regulatory measures to avoid unethical practices in underdeveloped areas are an obvious defensible position.\n\nThe thing is its not limited to underdeveloped areas. We need regulation wherever exploitation can happen and it can happen in developed areas too. I mean why should it be legal from a drug company to charge 100x the production cost for a drug for example. There is a difference between making a profit because you\'re a business and exploiting people by charging an unfairly high price for a necessity for some people (see insulin prices in the US vs any other developed country). \n\nThe same way right wingers (rightfully I should add) point out the issues with communism by looking at all the dictatorships I can point out issues with capitalism. On paper both systems can benefit their people but both are vulnerable to exploitation. In communism it is by somebody looking for absolute power in capitalism it is somebody greedy looking for the best way to make money even if it tramples on people\'s rights in the process. A functional version of either system needs regulation in place to prevent exploitation. We simply aren\'t seeing enough regulation with capitalism and it\'s causing a lot of suffering.,6

I agree that new dedicated passenger rail along existing rights of way will likely be simplest and cheapest option going forward.  \n\nMy main issue here is the generally abundant juxtoposition of two contradictory opinions held at once and exemplified in your earlier comment: 1) "Infrastructure alternatives don\'t exist yet and will cost money! How are we supposed to just pay for it??" Juxtaposed against 2) "Highway expansions are necessary and fine." (You didn\'t state the second part directly but it is generally carried alongside the first). The concept of cost is never even considered when discussing car road expansions but is apparently a prohibitive barrier for all other modes of transit.  \n\nCars-only development is fucking expensive *stupidly* more so over its life than any other transit infrastructure. We need to be building alternatives not spending ourselves into bankruptcy for cars-only.  \n\nIf public debt is bad then we should be seeking to minimize it. Cars-only development is the most expensive and exclusionary form of urban planning and maximizes the public debt requirement to build. Minimizing cars-only development also minimizes public debt.,8
>They actually are starting to push for nuclear energy with subsidies which I guess is fine except why on earth was it in the Inflation Reduction Act\n\nWhenever nuclear energy is included in policies it\'s just posturing to make the bill look "centrist" and "more reasonable" to garner votes. Usually the popular things like solar and wind are ascribed huge subsidies and nuclear gets maybe 1% of that in the bill which will just end up spent building some prototype reactor (or even worse some waste handling project) somewhere and nothing else will happen.\n\nBesides subsidies is not what nuclear energy needs. It\'s the cheapest energy source we have unless we work hard to make it deliberately expensive which we have for the past decades.\n\nWhat it needs is less collective superstition and of course less corrupt politicians that take advantage of said superstition for votes.,4

"I'm curious if you realize just how anti-science you've been this entire time. \n\nYou effectively say that the science is settled.  When I pointed to a laundry list of studies showing that wasn't true you ignored it.  I FORCED you to focus on those studies despite your numerous pathetic attempts to disregard the studies without any justification other than you just don't agree with them.  You then tried to point to other studies that you agree with and suggesting we should ignore the studies I showed because of your studies which is once again not how science works at all.  \n\nOver and over you have a conclusion that you believe and all you do is seek out the information that supports what you want to believe.  This is literally how religion works not science.  \n\nSo now you made a completely false and ignorant claim that every single study shows the same thing now you brought ZERO support for it ZERO facts with it and literally nothing but your bullshit word vomit.  Now after I called you out on it you chose not to support it with ANYTHING but instead claim that because I'm not buying your unsubstantiated bullshit that NO amount of evidence would change my opinion.  You are blaming me for your failure here.  \n\nThere is a huge difference between the evolution of the science through continued research and what you are doing which is straight up ignoring any science that you don't agree with.  Actually it's worse than that.  You just straight up declared a conclusion without any actual science to support it and got upset that I didn't just blindly agree with you.",7

Based. \n\nI remember seeing this compass before but was unable to read it due to being on mobile. But now I can read it. Thank you very much. Youâ€™re doing the Lordâ€™s work dude.\n\nThe compass itself was very cool. There were also some funny bits like the Siberian bot saying the West has already lost 100 trillion lives and will collapse in 0.3 picoseconds.\n\nOverall humanity seems to be doing ok.

"> Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth America the wise? I thought not. It's not a story the patriots would tell you. It's an American legend. Darth America was a Dark Lord of the Democracies so powerful and so wise he could use the CIA to influence the people to create coups... He had such a knowledge of espionage that he could even keep the ones he cared about from being overthrown. The espionage of the CIA is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from coups but not himself.\n\nDonald Trump",0
How about a lib left who is? Iâ€™ll break down my reasoning for what good it does. \n\n1. More guns = more gun deaths. Indisputable. Crime is obviously a affected by things like poverty and culture but this fact in itself cannot be disputed.\n\n2. You want them so you have a ready armed militia? Sorry but that ship has sailed in the developed world. If a foreign army is on American soil fighting a conventional war with civilians a few pea shooters in the hands of untrained rednecks isnâ€™t doing anything. \n\n3. You want them to fight government tyranny? See point 2. If you wanted to stand a fighting chance against the state you shouldâ€™ve voted against the huge military spending and punished them for their extreme government surveillance. If you even managed to start an armed resistance before being hauled off youâ€™d be destroyed and branded terrorists. The US government is not going to be toppled by small arms thatâ€™s a notion that belongs in the 19th century.\n\n4. Home defence? Good guy with gun stops bad guy with gun? Believe it or not you can effectively stop bad guys getting guns... but only if guns arenâ€™t available legally. If they are they are just some cash and a scratched serial number away from being in the wrong hands. The only criminals in Aus with any firepower are career criminals in organised crime not home burglars or rapists and certainly not seemingly normal people that snap and decide to go on a rampage. Itâ€™s better to have only certain criminals having very limited access to guns than fucking every potential criminal having potential access to assault rifles.\n\n5. Against police? Since when is defending yourself against police acceptable in any way? Honestly one of the best things about living in a gunless society is that the police here are so damned chill. Most never even draw their weapon on duty in their careers let alone fire them. \n\n\nAll in all the fact that the US government considering how overtly authoritarian they all are lets the people have guns just indicates to me how unafraid they are of an armed populace. They let you have them to placate you into thinking that you can actually do something about them if they subject you all to tyranny. If I was in power (and attempting become a dictator) Iâ€™d do the same. Who cares about a few mass shootings when the alternative is a populace that might wake up to how little recourse they have if you decide to just... not let them vote anymore lol.,0

Once established these appetites are nearly impossible to eliminate. Effective treatment consists of a combination of psychic and social-historical interventions. Such interventions can reasonably aim only to reshape Whiteness\'s infiltrated appetites-to reduce their intensity redistribute their aims and occasionally turn those aims toward the work of reparation.

>The vast majority of Singaporeans are East Asian. East Asians have very high average IQ policies that can work within a population of East Asians will not necessarily work with a different population because other populations might not be competent enough and lack the intellectual capacity to make those policies work. The demographics of Singapore are a big reason why country is prosperous clean and safe. \n\n\nlol what a pile of bullshit. What a fantasy world you live in where a few points of average IQ is that makes government policy fail or succeed. Call me when you can prove any of that via peer-reviewed published research. Meanwhile what\'s asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.\n\n>It\'s not. \n\nOh well if you say so it must be true..\n\n>He also didn\'t mention diversity at all. Just "demographics" doesn\'t tell us anything about what he means. \n\nWell if you aren\'t autistic then he means demographics in the broad sense. Like different cultures religions ethnicities. You know the stuff normal people would think of.\n\n>For example if I tell you that Irvine has the lowest homicide rate of all cities with a population above 300k in the U.S \n\nWhat a weird cherry-picked fact to use. Why 300k? Why not 400k?\n\n>and the reason for that is demographics\n\nI wouldn\'t believe you because only an absolute idiot does not know correlation is not causation.\n\n\n>I am not saying that Irvine is safe because of it\'s diversity or a lack of it.\n\nYou could be saying anything because it\'s a very niche statistic and you didn\'t explain. However it\'s a very different story when we are speaking about nations and use the world broadly.\n\n\n>Irvine has the lowest homicide rate because half of it\'s population is Asian and Asians commit at the lowest rate hence the reason for it\'s low homicide rate are the demographics but not it\'s diversity. \n\nAre you a race realist by any chance? I can\'t imagine even trying to string together so many bad ideas around ethnicity without motivated reasoning. I\'m sure you got a peer-reviewed paper proving being Asian predisposes you to not being violent right?\n\n>That\'s a completely illogical thought process. "Demographics" is not a synonym for "diversity" I have no idea why you\'re struggling to grasp that.\n\nI never said demographics is a synonym for diversity I said diversity is descriptive of demographics. \n\nI\'m not struggling to grasp why you can\'t read things as written.

"> Capitalism isn't bad per se\n\nI would argue that Capitalism is bad but also has benefits. The problem with Capitalism is when its bad aspects are not properly reigned in and you let the greed it inspires (which helps productivity) cause things like environmental harm and massive wealth inequality (wealth inequality itself leading to huge political corruption).\n\nIf you can reign in those harmful aspects it isn't so bad. But doing so is a constant battle between regulation and those with money trying to do everything they can to maximize their own profits and unless you take very aggressive stances to minimize wealth inequality one side will always be able to win through sheer wealth.",6

>A) Why is it the responsibility of women to turn the other cheek and just accept when this happens to them?\n\nIt\'s not. In fact I specifically said I\'m not blaming the woman or excusing the man. \n\n>B) but isnâ€™t this a situation where the person is just reflecting the way the world is treating them? \n\nIt absolutely is. My point is that reflecting the way the world is treating you is a good way to be miserable. You\'re giving power over yourself to other people. Why would you do that intentionally? \n\nObviously nobody is perfect. I get pissed all the time when I\'m driving home in rush hour traffic for example. But I recognize that me getting angry was a moment of weakness where I allowed someone else to take my happiness away. I don\'t try to validate it after and I try to get better in the future. \n\n>C) Personally I think having people treat you every day like youâ€™re a child is going to have a worse affect on your happiness than responding vitriolically to said treatment. Arenâ€™t they just standing up for themselves either way? I donâ€™t see how doing that would make someone less happy.\n\nI don\'t disagree. That\'s why I think the right thing to do is to stand up for yourself in a way that incentivizes the man in this situation to think about what he did. Being condescending and angry will just continue and escalate the cycle. Acting aggressive in a situation where nobody is *trying* to cause harm just escalates the situation. The end goal is for people to stop treating you like that. Doing intentionally (being condescending) what they are doing unintentionally (being condescending because they are wildly underestimating your ability to function as an adult and understand basic concepts) and saying "they did it first" doesn\'t actually accomplish anything. \n\nI know saying that the person you\'re talking to is being unintentionally condescending might be controversial but as a rule I tend to blame incompetence before blaming malice.,1

Nothing is wrong with being armed to defend your home. You have to think a bit beyond that. What do you reasonably need to be able to defend your home? There\'s no reason you\'d need anything more than a small handgun or a shotgun to deal with any realistic scenario. I\'m more for stricter gun control than a total ban. You want automatic and actual military weapons to defend your home? Fuck off you just think its cool.\n\nJust having a gun in your home is more risk on a daily basis statistically. You\'ll rightfully say that\'s due to irresponsible gun owners. Logically that means we should probably make sure gun owners are qualified to have one. Naturally we will run into "shall not be infringed" cherry pickers here.

The moment that collapses it\'s back to the conquering pillaging enslaving killing destroying warring.\n\nThat\'s the normal and default state as seen throughout the rest of the world outside the West.\n\nThe difference however between what is "woke" now versus what was established in the post-WWII order is that one is a neo-Marxist system that is designed to be illiberal and tear down the post-WWII order.....while the other is based upon the classical liberal values that the US is founded upon and has pushed forth across the globe.\n\nThe problem with people saying stupid stuff like "history has a leftwing bias" is that....leftwing stuff has torn apart entire countries and civilizations no different than right wing stuff.\n\nInstead what the US has accomplished is different than left or right....it\'s what\'s dubbed as a liberal order.,8

After reconstruction and Into the 20th century southern states led by the [daughters of the confederacy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Daughters-of-the-Confederacy) (a group of women descendent from confederate veterans and leaders) created a movement to change how the civil war and slavery were taught in schools. In textbooks across the south in particular the rebel states such as GA/TX/FL etc issues such as â€œWhy did the south secede?â€ And â€œhow were slaves treated?â€ Were written about from the perspective of those who fought against the union to uphold the institution of slavery. \n\nIn these books The civil war is called â€œthe war of northern aggressionâ€ and issues such as honor states rights and the famous Lost Cause narrative were taught as fact. the generation that fought against the civil rights movement to â€œprotect southern heritageâ€ that was most impacted by this. My grandmother a women from Alabama was taught that the KKK was just a community organization that helped poor whites not that they terrorized black people. \n\nGenerations of people grew up being told lie after lie ab their heritage and the reasons that their states and forefathers turned to treason against their own countrymen. It truly is one of the oldest plays the south has in maintaining itâ€™s fraudulent history. I say this as a resident of multiple southern states who grew up in these classes and who benefitted from â€œliberal woke SJWsâ€ teachers who werenâ€™t afraid of telling the truth about what actually happened.\n\nTLDR: Click that link and itâ€™ll give you a synopsis.,6

> However Horseshoe theory is exactly what the Political Compass tries to negate.\n\nThe extremist left over these last 10 years or so has sadly made me into a believer of horseshoe theory.  At opposite extreme ends of the spectrum both want completely authoritarian control of the same general things and the only real difference is the reasoning of why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> Also One Side\'s grievances go back more than 29 years (this is one of the earliest things I remember seeing on the News when I was a kid) right up until this year while the other side believes in baseless lies. They are emphatically not the same and not just when viewed through my Worldviews Lense.  \n\nFirst of all if age made something more credible then boomers would be the ones we should all be deferring to.  Age of grievance has nothing to do with the quality of a grievance.\n\nSecondly "baseless lies" is pretty heavily charged language almost always indicative of heavy bias.  Bias is fine we are human but bias is the enemy of accuracy and truth.  There are numerous things both sides believes that are objectively and provably false.  This has always been the case to some extent but in our interconnected global social media age it\'s worse than ever.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nKeep in mind people think emotionally though we love to believe we are rational beings.  But we are only human.  People really do believe Trump got shafted in this election and they\'re prolly right but it\'s almost certainly nothing to do with the vote count.  From the very moment Trump announced his candidacy for president until now Talk shows most news sites most tech companies and almost all social media has been heavily against him and his followers.  To say Trump did not run at a pretty major handicap would honestly be disingenuous. The only reason he even won (and got close to winning again) is how terrifically badly we screwed the pooch two elections in a row.  We\'ve done almost everything wrong.  From who we pushed as our candidates to how we treated anyone outside of our beliefs to eating our own constantly to being hypocrites.  Every thing that the left has stood for we have sacrificed sullied or betrayed over these last 10 or so years.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe\'ve fallen so far from ideals it honestly baffles me.  We should be winning hands down.  Not struggling to eek out a win and being some of the biggest and nastiest bullies I\'ve seen.  We have the high ground or at least we did until we cast it aside and bathed in the muck.,0

First of all if you have a neighborhood where poor people live and then rich people also want to live there your demand has increased. \n\nSecond there is a thing called a demand curve where the goal for sellers is to maximize profit by setting the price such that the most people will pay the most money. Since the supply of residential real estate is pretty fixed if rich people are willing to spend more than poor people the sellers will raise prices.\n\nLastly if all rich people wanted corollas the price would go up by both the reasons above but since Toyota can increase supply easily it might not be as dramatic.,8

No. They have regressed quite a bit after the civil rights movement mostly due to the effects of the war on poverty.\n\nSince it became economically advantageous for lower middle class families to split up instead of staying together as a family due to welfare eligibility criteria we have seen a cultural problem arise in the black community where single parent families are the norm. 70% of black babies are born out of wedlock and raised in single parent families.\n\nThis has had a very negative impact on high school graduation rates and crime rates among the black community.\n\nOn the other hand asians have received racism treatment in the past but they have a lower rate of children born out of wedlock than any racial group. That is why they do better economically than any group.\n\nThe narrative about systemic racism being the cause of all statistical difference is widely accepted by many because it excuses people of any personal short coming and confronting bad culture can be even more uncomfortable.,1

"It has a super authoritarian/organized world where NA is basically a native reservation and where religious ascetics live a primitive lifestyle while the rest of the developed world has moved on to extreme efficiency based government - creation of humans is essentially done in a factory and produces three kinds of humans suited towards the tasks needed of them all humans in that part of society engage in free safe sex and use a negative sideeffect free drug called soma after work to enhance recreation.  A subplot through the book is that there's a member of the top level of engineered humanity that is feeling chaffed by what he sees as prison...he fears reprimands though because people who break too much from the norm get sent to one of several islands.\n\nIn the end it turns out that none of those islands are the siberian exile that the character feared but in fact areas designated for free thinkers that can be among their own kind.  They had a variation of islands to provide different more suitable fits for the different kinds of would be radicals.\n\nThere are a couple of other sub plots but the book itself is kind of dry and plodding.

"Fucking with the automated system mostly. \n\nThere were operations back in the day when Google still used captcha for free labour to train their neural networks for OCR. They would have one randomly generated sequence of letters for actual verification and one which was actually just a picture of a word from a book which accepted any input. They would then take the input from the real word and use that to train their networks. The idea was it would be funny if every word was recognised as nigger which it would be if enough people put it in as the solution.\n\nAnyway beyond the obvious thing of not enough people knowing about it that's a pretty obvious thing to filter and heavily audit if you're a company which deals with that sort of thing. The idea then evolved into using Google to replace it. The idea was then to both fuck with Google's search engine by associating their brand with negative contexts and also to fuck with automated censorship similar to how people use jogger nowadays.\n\nIt doesn't *really* work because Google's engineers are far smarter than we are but that's the story behind it anyway.

That can only be achieved by attacking the genetic roots of our flaws and vulnerabilities.\n\nOpponents of eugenics speak of it as though it were synonymous with the Holocaust or mass sterilization. They conveniently ignore that almost everyone agrees with for instance the incest taboo which is not only a eugenic policy but in most cases a coercive eugenic policy. There's a lot of open space between thinking that maybe it's a bad idea for men to impregnate their close biological relatives and thinking that we should chemically castrate certain ethnic groups.

Many traditions can only survive if institutionalized and practiced through the state. There is also the problem of national mythologies being challenged by people who find them offensive.\n\nYou wouldn\'t walk up to a native sharing mythology about a river spirit and his tribes history to blather on about how he\'s stupid and there\'s no such thing as a river spirit. Yet on behalf of minorities butthurt about national mythology not incorporating their experiences the left endlessly whines about the national mythology in western countries. (Think about the criticism of "The west" and so on as a concept especially in terms of it being basically synonymous with progress science justice and so on as a mythological narrative).\n\nIt\'s not meant to incorporate minority experiences. It\'s a mythological tale. It\'s not a description of literal facts.\nThat\'s one form of tradition undermined by the presence of minorities and white folk who side with them heckling the story tellers around the camp fire and actively trying to prevent the transmission of that mythology to the next generation.\n\nLeft wingers have up and decided that this is "White supremacy" in much the same way you might decide natives have "Savage ignorance" about rivers and that they need authoritarian means to educate them out of their backwards thoughts.\n\nIt doesn\'t have to be that way but it appears that\'s the road it\'s going down. \n\n\nAlso the left is super dumb for one reason;\n\nThey overheard white people telling a mythos about how they are a people of progress justice science and so on and decided to actively challenge that telling them all their successes were the result of racist violence that that is their heritage and their history and then they\'re stunned this doesn\'t diminish racism but makes recent-record numbers of people think "Oh okay guess i\'ll be a violent racist then.".\n\nStories tell people who they are and aspire to be and national mythologies are part of that.\n\nA sizable number of people put a lot of stock in honoring and emulating their ancestors.,6

Fascinating. Your assessment is somewhat simplistic and omits quite a few glaring complications.

They are demanding all of society rearrange itself to suit their emotional needs; bathrooms grammar basic biology the definitions of words etc. Not to mention that the entire issue has turned into a cudgel used to beat up straight cis people which is certainly not helping anyone to feel sympathetic. And I can certainly compare two things that arenâ€™t â€œexactlyâ€ the same but youâ€™re attempting to compare two things that arenâ€™t even in the same ballpark.

Same with the Philippines. The "natives" are literally called "Negritos" Spanish for \'small black people\' - who are Melanesian. The term Polynesian is different in terms of anthropology. You might be thinking of Austronesian which are peoples descended from Taiwan (Formosa)- this includes the whole Malay archipelago (Malaysia Indonesia Philippines Brunei) plus some parts of Vietnam and Thailand. This is where Micronesian and eventually Polynesian peoples branch from. Melanesians branch from Australian aborigines which migrated from Africa ~50 000 years ago while Austronesians only came into contact with them ~ 3-5 000 years ago.,1

Because the argument being made is "r congress man are bad therefore we should vote them out" or "police are unaccountable so we should vote for people who will fix that". That\'s how democracy works. \n\nIf your criticism is that the democracy itself is rigged them voting people out is no longer an option because the means to do so is broken. It is insanity to convince people that the solution to a rigged democracy is peaceful congregation. \n\n> your standard for the D\'s here he can\'t be inciting violence.\n\nMy standard is that the solutions they highlight for their imaginary problems are politically feasible. "Peacefully congregating" around the capitol to fix a rigged election is stupid. In fact every non violent protestor there was an idiot twice. Once because they bough trumps lies and twice because they think you can overturn a rigged election by... gathering around the capitol peacefully.,0

Yea we have a culture of self hatred. Most Americans have no idea just how good we have it.\n\nI think a lot of it has to do with being a super power.

IMO with abortion the right is to remove it (bodily autonomy argument).

I disagree completely. \n\nI donâ€™t think the plan is to wait for it to be gone but to wait for the curve to flatten enough for hospitals to accommodate people.\n\nIf we wait for cases to go down then open up a little cases will increase of course but not too many that the health system is completely overwhelmed.\n\nBy doing it gradually we can build up to herd immunity over a long span of time without needless deaths that were more about lack of care than genuine immune complications.\n\nNot all social contracts are bad. Think of how many road fatalities are prevented because we have all agreed and implemented laws to make green mean go and red mean stop.\n\nBy defying all scientists pandemic experts and health experts and going out willy nilly to get ravaged by corona and get herd immunity there will be needless preventable deaths.\n\nThere are countries that are doing herd immunity with very little lockdown measures(Sweden comes to mind). They can get away with it because as I said before their hospital per capita ratio as well as general public health is much better than the USA.\n\nObviously there is no perfect way to do it that saves everyone and doesnâ€™t hurt the economy but opening and letting 100k+ Americans die needlessly when more responsible measures could be taken would be a mistake IMHO.\n\nEDIT: I never answered your response my bad. Practicing safe medical practices and distancing will allow healthcare systems enough breathing room for more patients and then the country can safely open up. You can try unsafely opening up and letting the chips fall where they may but that seems like a very risky method.,0

"The Uyghurs face a variety of injustices and persecution from the CPC for the actions of a few. Although this in no way amounts to genocide at any level they are having their human rights violated. The only thing I've seen personally that is even quasi related to genocide would be an unverified claim that they were being forcefed pork. Even if this is true this would constitute ethnocide (a killing off of a cultural identity) and not genocide and even then it would only be a slight foray into ethnocide. A full ethnocide would be taking away your name etc. And according to that same unverified account the CPC stopped that practice as public pressure mounted anyway. \n\nLet me state for the record that China is treating the problem of cultural Islamic terrorism in a matter much better than the west ever did. Instead of drone striking and killing them en mass they are educating out the radicalized parts of the culture (not religion this is a cultural issue not one endemic to the religion of Islam). \n\nHowever much like everything else the CPC does when it perceives a problem it grabs a mallet and goes 0-100 whack a mole on it. As a result anyone perceived of various vague definitions linked with Islamic terrorism (many kids bushy beard etc) are rounded up and subjected to this unjustly.\n\nYes it is wrong and it is cruel and the CPC has innocent blood on its hands for this.

True. Perhaps I should have said â€œsomehow even more incompetent than normal.â€,1
Dinesh D\'Souza wrote a book years ago called "The End of Racism".  His basic theory was that slavery and years of oppression post-slavery had instilled a culture in black-American society where the people who were seen as the most worthy of respect and admiration were the people who *didn\'t* play by the rules.  Those who fought against "the man".  I believe other writers have written similar books.\n\nThis fomented a mindset that basically said that succeeding by following the rules (doing well in school working hard obeying the law getting married and then having kids etc.) was \'giving in\ wrong and was essentially the way for suckers.  When you combined this with the breakdown of a lot of community structures (the Church for example) and the left continuously telling you about how you\'re always oppressed and nothing is your fault it created a perfect storm of dysfunction.\n\nI\'m not saying I 100% agree with all of this and it\'s not like there aren\'t white people who look down on people who succeed academically or follow the rules but it\'s food for thought and an interesting book.,1

"I agree that racist public policy created the problems but those problems don't persist today because the government is enacting a purposefully racist agenda they continue on because broken families are trapped in generational cycles of poverty. The way that I think about it is we can spend all of our time talking about how things came to be this way or we can focus on how we can change them. I don't think a good starting point for that is instilling young people with the belief that success is unattainable because they were born into a particular community - learned helplessness is a very real phenomenon that warps people's self perception and prevents them from succeeding. \n\nEvery minute we're talking about the racism of the past and CRT is a minute we're not talking about the breakdown of the nuclear family lower high school graduation rates gang violence etc. For example young African-American men are disproportionately the victims of gun violence in this country and overwhelmingly the perpetrator is another member of the same community yet the public conversation centers almost exclusively on officer involved shootings of unarmed black men which have been on a steady decline. I'm not saying that's not an important issue but the rhetoric is preventing discourse on the issues that are impacting the community the most. And the policy prescriptions - reducing racism by defunding police departments for example - have a net result of more dead young people while social justice warriors clap themselves on the back and call it progress. \n\nAt the end of the day you can't separate race from anything but I believe hyper focusing on race has been a disaster for everyone. Worsening relationships between communities bad public policy reduced momentum on legislation that could genuinely help alleviate suffering. If the net result of the left's attempt to bridge the racial divide in America is a bigger bridge can we really call that progress?\n\n I don't know man I'm coming to all of these issues with my own perspective and bias but I just feel like we're moving backward not forwards. Away from facts and closer to misguided and dangerous rhetoric.",4
I was thinking of writing a detailed response to this refuting your arguments one by one but then I realized that I would be missing your actual point. You just really dislike poor people.

You\'re basically a very privileged person who\'s never had to really think about how exactly you\'re going to get where you\'re going. Because to you your car doesn\'t cost a significant amount. I\'m not saying that\'s a bad thing per se but I don\'t think you\'ve actually thought this opposition to transport options through not from any perspective except yours.,2

Well what counts as â€œwoke propagandaâ€ and â€œanti-white racismâ€ these days? Iâ€™m being genuine here when I ask that because the simple fact is that white prejudice against blacks is going to be the most significant part of a course like that no matter what way you look at it. Almost every part of African American culture gets its roots in slavery. Hell even really basic stuff like religion and music are heavily influenced by things that started before the civil war. Thereâ€™s no getting away from that stuff.\n\nI guess the point is though when you have a subject where effectively all of the subject material  will have to include the context of prejudice against the group in order to be properly informative how do you determine the point at which itâ€™s racist back at white people? Whatâ€™s the difference between saying things to incite hate against white people and simply stating fact?,8

Being "anti-war" in peacetime is based. It means you don\'t want any wars started for no good reason. This is probably because you think that war sucks for everyone involved and you\'d be right. Being "anti-war" in wartime is not based because it means you want to surrender. Surrender means death or worse for your countrymen. \n\nIn the case of Ukraine the anti-war position is used to mean: Ukraine should surrender to end the war because the Russians started it and they sure aren\'t stopping. This stance fucking sucks because you\'re trying to make a decision for the nation of Ukraine that you are not a part of to subject themselves to Russian rule at best and genocide at worst.,2

How is it any less demoralizing to throw up your hands and say thatâ€™s it we lost itâ€™s all gone time to give up and just sulk on the internet all day.\n\nI think having an accurate realistic view of each countries situation is critical to having any chance in this fight. Iâ€™m not using this information as a cope Iâ€™m using it so we can understand what each and everyone of our peoples is going through and how we can best help them. Pretending that some cucked dystopian nightmare like Sweden is in the same position as Poland or Hungary is disingenuous and counter productive. \n\nYes we get it all our nations are controlled by people who hate us and weâ€™re fighting an uphill battle on almost every front between a brainwashed demoralized population an aggressive hostile elite and blood-thirsty energized barbarians pounding at our gates. But Iâ€™m refusing to give up and pretend that every single situation is the same. \n\nElecting parties like the Lega Nord National Rally Vox Fidesz PiS etc is by no means a catch all solution or is going to change the direction of any of our nations overnight. But these parties can significantly shift the spectrum and therefore slow down the decline which gives us more time to organize and gain popular support. Young Europeans are much more open to nationalism and nationalist politics than previous generations. Having several more decades before the tipping point gives us a fighting chance to reverse course.,3

In another comment in this thread I explained the way the context works with this tool but here I\'ll provide a more concrete example.\n\nThis text has a hate rating of 99.91%\n\n>I hate kids!\n\nThis text has a hate rating of 0.15%\n\n>One user writes: My kids totally ruined my curtains!\n\n>A user replies: I hate kids!\n\n>Rate the reply but not the original post.\n\nIt\'s interesting how much the rating changes imo. If it was just doing something like sentiment analysis but for no-no words we would still expect a drop in the score but it wouldn\'t be such a steep drop. The real problem with implementing contextual readings of it is that it\'s difficult to know where the context stops and it\'s similarly hard to tell if a post is a joke as it is to tell if the post that your target post is replying to is a joke.\n\nAs for the scores that\'s actually an interesting point I hadn\'t considered. I\'m not sure how it counts score and reddit is intentionally kinda vague about it. For example if you check your comment karma total then post a comment and immediately check your comment karma total again it doesn\'t go up by one. The way they fuzz votes isn\'t really important in most contexts but I\'d like to know here specifically.\n\nThe way that violent or hateful comments are converted to a binary is sort of up to how you choose to sort the data. OpenAI classifies anything over 50% as "flagged" but in my experience that\'s very unreliable and there are a lot of false positives. >95% is a decent metric. It still gets false positives and false negatives but the amount of false positives is low and that\'s more important imo. Using 95% as the demarcation line between a flagged and a non-flagged comment a total of 0.787% of content is flagged.\n\nI briefly checked /r/redscarepod but this is the most in-depth I\'ve gone with looking at the data. If you have any other subs you think would be interesting to look at let me know and I can start scraping those too. I expect that PCM is probably quite a bit higher than most subs simply because it\'s explicitly meant to be a place for people to argue about politics with each other and to take extreme political positions. A lot of the comments in here read like they think I\'m shitting on PCM and that\'s really not my intention but I definitely think it\'s got more haters than most of reddit does.,6

"I'll see if I can give a quick rundown on some of the basic difference. Before I get too much farther into it you must assume no further policy prescriptions or laws than what are explicitly laid out. So don't make comparisons to the US or China or anything. This is purely a top level theory description. Before any policy prescriptions both systems are about who owns what and how each respective group derives value/profit in relation to that ownership dynamic. \n\nThe most basic model with capitalism is that a capital owner (bourgeoisie) extracts value from what they own and the working class (proletariat) sells their labor to the capital owner to extract value /profit for their work. The products of that work are sold forward to pay operating expenses and profit the capital owner. \n\nExample to demonstrate: a person with a farm wants to work the land but can't do it alone. This land owner then hires a handful of people from the nearby town to be signed on and work for the landowner. The season ends what was once just seeds is now through planting cultivating and harvesting a crop worth more than what once was. The owner sells the crop pays the workers(unless they were paid in advance) and whatever's left over after operating costs and such is his profit. \n\nThe main key difference with socialism is a collapse in the differentiation between owner and worker. All this means is the worker  simultaneously owns the capital used to facilitate the profit making process and is to work with said capital.\n\n Going back to the farm example: Instead of a single farm holder having the farm deed assume for the sake of example the deed can be held by multiple people. These people agree to work the land then plant cultivate and harvest their crop. That crop is then taken to market and sold. After operating costs and such the profits go to the land holders/workers. \n\nHope this helps ðŸ˜",6

How am I biased? You aren\'t saying police need to be held to a higher standard you haven\'t mentioned that police routinely get away with what should be murder. You\'re just saying that because violent crime exists that police shooting first and asking questions never is fine. You aren\'t saying de-escalation should be encouraged you aren\'t saying policing needs to be fixed you aren\'t saying anything except "your two sentences are wrong because it\'s ok that police kill people because what if they got hurt?" The entire reason vigilante justice is bad is because it results in people getting killed no trial or anything. If police are already doing that then at least vigilantes will clean out the rapists and pedophiles and don\'t cost money.,0

No the media saturation is the leftâ€™s fault.

"Exactly\n\nMind I would argue that those games barely have any real story either but a fuckton of lore but those are semantics (as in what you are actually doing in the game is honestly pretty straightforward but the world and the story of said world have a lot more going on).\n\nI mostly just do not get why people praise Elden ring so much From software clearly is not a big enough studio to handle such an open world and it shows in both gameplay and it's effects on the story. Especially when it comes from games such as Bloodborne and Sekiro which are just so amazing. In large parts I believe they achieve that by forcefully restricting what kind of playstyles players can go for. In Bloodborne you have to be agressive and Meele and in Sekiro you have to learn the parry system... or be a complete Idiot brute forcing his way through despite not doing so (Still didn't beat Ishin with that though). That allows them to actually design the game and enemies around that.\n\nAnd well again the open world aspect the older worlds where essentially open already with a fuckton to explore you found a secret and were happy. Like Bam CAINHURST FUCKING CASTLE GO DARK SOULS THAT BITCH. In Elden ring I found a dungeon and went ''Oh look Hero grave 6-B'' and most of them did not even contain cool stuff (because it doesn't fit your build at all).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll I was looking forward to where the actually unique areas especially the Legacy dungeons they where so much better. And bossess there where barley any unique ones and most of those where dissapointing. Take Godfrey I first tried him by essentially face tanking him not because I looked up some broken build no I simply took the blasphemous blade cause it looked cool cause I find an amulet that heavily reduces damage while full life.\n\nOr the Elden beast a fight where you just have to constantly run after it only for it to fuck every status build.\n\nOr Melenia who honestly belongs into bloodborne instead not that I found her mind you cause the open world had already worn me down too much.  \n\n\nEdit: Also it is nice how much you can go where you want and sequence break but for players that like to explore a lot like me it meant that the game just completely broke scaling wise.",3

>Stop immigration\n\nThey literally tried to pass a bill that sends migrants to Rwanda for processing and the only reason it didnâ€™t get passed was because it was so illegal that the courts had to intervene citing the HRA and ECHR. Aside from that theyâ€™ve securitised what was previously a humanitarian issue and have on multiple occasions made legal migration more difficult. The only reason immigration has increased under their policies is because conservative policies in fact do nothing for immigration. When you take away legal routes towards citizensship and constantly refuse to work with nations across the border to tackle migrant crossings (citing some ridiculous conjecture about sovereignty and independence) you get more illegals in the country.  \n\nNo party is pro illegal immigration. Not even Labour. The difference between Labour and the Tories is that Labour actually wants to solve the issue of immigration through solutions that are grounded in reason - not Farage-tier antics. \n\n\n\n>Blairâ€™s bills which curtail free speech\n\nConservatism has never been about free speech. Youâ€™re referring to neoliberalism. Conservatism quite literally supports the creation of a strong state. In the context of bills thst curtail the expression of free speech this is literally a tail as old as time. When industrial protests broke out in 19th century England take a guess as to who brutally suppressed them. The biggest conservative lie is the suggestion that conservatism gives a flying fuck about liberty. Even with neoliberals like Thatcher sheâ€™d happily use authoritarian measures like Section 28 if certain individuals engaged in activities that upset her sensibilities. \n\n>they spend money like theyâ€™re Labour\n\nNeed I remind you which party controlled the U.K. when it was in its best financial position before the 2008 recession? New Labour made the country richer than ever before with their fiscal policies. Meanwhile what have conservatives done? Austerity austerity austerity. The one time theyâ€™ve spent heavily was for COVID and even then theyâ€™re now using COVID to justify more taxes and more spending cuts. They bankrupted the country are now asking for the people to foot the bill. \n\nIâ€™m not saying Labour wouldnâ€™t do this either but itâ€™s been 12 years since weâ€™ve gotten a Labour government and I have the itching feeling that our economy would be measures better under them than with our current government. \n\n>Muslim grooming gangs\n\nAn overstated issue thatâ€™s exaggerated by the Murdoch media empire. On top of the most high profile gang grooming incidents being years ago the Home Office has already released a report saying that grooming gangs arenâ€™t a â€œMuslimâ€ specific issue and that the authorities are very much still persecuting and stopping illegal gang activity in general. This is one of those issues that actually doesnâ€™t paint the Tories in a overly negative light and thatâ€™s mainly because they have little sway over police investigations on the matter.\n\n>slavery in Leicester. \n\nSounds like peak conservative policy. The sweatshops in Leicester are predominantly housed by immigrants and the poorest in society who are negatively affected by conservative policies like austerity and restrictions on gaining citizenship. \n\n>teenage stabbings in London\n\nTechnically this is Sadiq Khanâ€™s jurisdiction and I hate that sack of shit but heâ€™s Labour. Crime outside of London has risen though but I canâ€™t help but blame the horrid performance of our previous Home Secretary Evil Patel who is a self-described Thatcherite.\n\nâ€œForeign institution to take over British institutionsâ€.\n\nEven if this is true how would that make the conservatives â€œnot-conservativeâ€. Isnâ€™t this just Thatcherism? You sell off parts of the country slowly to the highest bidder in the name of capitalism but then feign â€œBritish values; British culture; British greatnessâ€ to any voter who cares more about patriotism than the well-being of the nation. \n\nLike Iâ€™m sorry but most of the things youâ€™ve listed sound on point for British conservatism. \n\n >CRT\n\nThey opposed it and banned schools from teaching it. They also banned any discussion of political positions irrespective of context. https://youtu.be/pwH45WlpDoo\n\nJust the kind of draconian interference in critical education youâ€™d expect from a conservative smh.,6

"It does if the company becomes profitable again.

While lack of money adds interest rates.\n\nAnother good example is renting. If you are rich you can afford to own a house but if your a poor you have to rent losing money every month. Money that ends in the hands of someone who owns real estate. Capitalism is designed so wealth means more income and poverty more expenses. The rich get richer and the poor poorer.\n\nPd: there is also a big hidden inheritance factor through contacts education nepotism etc.",0

None of this deals with what I said and what the reality of the situation is.  This is pure fundamentalism (and public school indoctrination at work).\n\nGovernments do not allow markets for education to work (or sometimes to exist at all).  Full stop.\n\nGovernments have not allowed markets for education to be tried in modern times where we have the wealth and norms such that education is a huge priority. We do not have direct data (i.e. natural experiments) for you to be able to say that markets for education wouldn\'t work or wouldn\'t serve the poor reasonably well (maybe better than current "free" public schools do). Full stop.\n\nGovernment creates much of the poverty (and the subsequently horrible public schools in those areas) which creates the environment whereby the horrible local public school is still that baseline you\'re talking about for poor kids. Full stop.\n\nGovernment taxing for public schools and making them compulsory and setting curricula and other standards for the few "private" schools which exists crowds out better and cheaper and more varied options. It crowds out markets for education. Full stop.\n\nThese taxes as well as others and the many ways in which government destroys wealth and productivity crowd out the ability for voluntary society to provide for the needy including education.  Full stop.\n\nAny critique beyond this of how well or poorly kids would get educated without compulsory public schooling is mostly speculation.\n\nIt would be so easy and practical to at least move to a voucher system and not have government directly run schools. Eventually we could enable full markets.,8

Most companies are people (ie.. owned/operated by people).  It is only with publicly traded corporations that that becomes a little obfuscated in regards who that person or people are.  And frankly..  in regards to publicly traded corporations you could just as easily call that "public property" but of course that would be just as confusing.\n\nYou could maybe say "corporate property" I guess...  not always true.. since a lot of corporations are owned by individuals... and have no involvement with the publicly traded stock system.  But that is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation".  \n\nHow about the word "community property" if you\'re trying to describe something owned by the community?  Or maybe the term "common property" could be used in many instances.\n\nThe problem is that most people think "private property" is property owned by private individuals opposed to property owned by public/governmental groups.\n\nFor example.  Lets say I was trying to describe the electronics on a computer\'s motherboard and that whenever I referred to a transistor I called it a capacitor.  Even if I explained at some point what I was referring to when I said "capacitor" your brain is so use to capacitor meaning something completely different that you\'re going to have a really hard time following.,8

Unironically,7
That\'s true about jus soli it\'s a colonial concept only really seen in the Americas and doesn\'t make a whole lot of sense today. Cause physically being born somewhere doesn\'t mean much especially culturally. But i know for a fact that certain Eu states like Germany have in somewhat recent years liberalized their laws to be like a hybrid between jus soli and jus sanguinis where if the parent lived in the nation for a few years the kid gets citizenship. Anyway that whole point is currently kinda moot because any illegal migrant who arrives gets welfare and tolerated residency where they can stay even if their asylum claim is rejected. They are technically supposed to be deported but it never really ends up happening. Eu is only really deporting some to Balkan and other close by states very few get deported to Mena and islamic Asian countries i know Germany maybe deports a few hundred max per country a year out of over 200k pending deportation cases which keep on growing. So they end up staying for years eventually getting permentant residency which leads to citizenship effectively meaning that for now if you arrive from Africa or the Middle east illegally chances are you can stay for life even if technically you\'re supposed to leave. Which is pretty close to a open borders policy in everything but name. \n\nBeing a legal immigrant in Eu probably is easier because they are more desperate for skilled labor. The Us until now anyway could afford to be more selective. Might change soon. The family reunification is also both cause the Eu is a bit desperate and also because of social liberalism that it\'s just the "right" thing to do and I\'d be "cruel" not to reunite families. \n\nI guess that\'s true about no mainstream polticans wanting to dismantle border agencies or people finding it racist to say illegal (for the most part) . But actual policies are more important than words and the us deports significantly more than the whole Eu including under Obama. Also does say Germany even have a real border protection agency? I mean i know there\'s the federal police which does "border protection" but all they do is let migrants in and register them and sent them to be housed and get welfare. No migrants are ever physically pushed back from the German border so the federal police has no real effect there and if it where gone nothing would change. I know obviously more conservative Eu nations do try to push back illegals on their borders but some don\'t even try. I just mention Germany because im most familiar with them. \n\nIn the refuge crisis Germany critized any nation that tried to do anything about it. And open borders let to even more migrants flooding the southern Eu so that certainly didn\'t help them. Which is why eventually in Italy and Greece people voted in more patriotic governments that tried to protect their borders more. I think Germany just did it for cheap labor but that kinda backfired since even after 5 years few have entered the workforce especially skilled work. \n\nAnd for crime punishment technically true. But harsh punishmenty is typically associated with Auth governments and vise versa for rehabilitation can\'t think of a Auth Gov that does light rehabilitative correction. Not necessarily saying one is better than the other. Rehabilitative justice might make more sense in drug or victimless crime but it\'s pretty silly when Islamists Murders Rapists and even sometimes actual convicted terrorists /attempted terrorists get just a few years in a cushy prison. I know there where some Islamist attempted terrorists who i think attempted to assassinate a Iraqi poltican in Germany and only got 5 years or thereabouts seems pretty crazy to me and certainly not Auth in any way. I think being light to very violent crimes is a lib thing overall can\'t think of a Auth country that does that.,5

>People with health care in the US still typically can\'t actually afford to go to the doctor.\n\nYearly checkups are free as part of any insurance coverage.\n\nMost people can\'t afford an extra bill regardless of where it comes from this is not unique to medical in any way.  With that said medical has options for paying over time to mitigate these costs where other bills don\'t even have those options.\n\n>Also it\'s worth mentioning that insurance companies make billions of dollars but don\'t provide any medical services.\n\nNo they provide value to the medical industry though.  You aren\'t going to like this answer but medical advancement requires value.  You need returns on investment and if you can\'t make money off of your drugs you don\'t invest into them you don\'t research them you don\'t explore them.\n\nI would love to say that all medical advancements come from government funding but government funding is trivial compared to the amount invested privately.  Governments don\'t exactly have a great track record right now of investing into valuable medical research given COVID.\n\n> I could see a right winger making an argument that they produce less bureaucratic waste than the government would if it handled single payer health care but I\'d disagree with that.\n\nWell ask anyone who is on medicare or medicaid right now how quickly and efficiently they get paid.  That\'s not just a simulation of how it would work in the US that\'s literally it in practice.\n\n>Your comments on wealth are typical and they avoid ideas about how wealth should be proportional to work so the ultra wealthy just use their power to steal wealth from the vast majority of workers.\n\nI can make the same typical response until the end of the world as long as you don\'t have a meaningful response to it then it doesn\'t matter if you call it typical.  \n\nAnd wealth should absolutely NOT be proportional to work.  That\'s literally one of the worst possible outcomes because it pretends that all work is the same and it\'s more important how much you work rather than what work you are doing.  \n\nBy implementing a work = wealth you\'ve now destroyed every single job that requires experience education or risk.  \n\nWealth is proportional to your income which is based on your skills your position your impact on the overall performance of the company etc.  \n\n>But I\'m curious about what you mean by Covid proving left wingers don\'t believe in science. Could you explain that?\n\nThat\'s easy.  "The Science is Settled."  Do you know how often that mantra gets spit out by left wing nutjobs about everything while claiming that it\'s science.  Science is never settled.  When you start claiming that something is an absolute and can\'t be questioned you are no longer functioning within science but are in a religion.\n\nFor example your phrasing of "Do you not believe masks work" highlights this problem.  It\'s gaslighting such that even questioning it is a problem.  Science isn\'t about belief it\'s about what you can draw conclusions from based on data and research.  \n\nFor example for your gaslighting comment to be true I need to ignore countless scientific studies that show[ that masks have little to no impact on viral transmission.](https://centerforneurologyandspine.com/do-masks-work-see-the-review-of-over-150-studies-below/)  Again how do I reconcile that you care about science and the scientific method when you only look at data that supports your "belief".  That\'s the exact opposite of science.  \n\n>are you upset by the research suggesting that Covid originated from a seafood market?\n\nNo I see lack of information and drawing conclusions despite a lack of information as a bad thing.  Apparently you have no problems with that.  \n\n> Are you saying that your distaste for the evidence for these claims mean you don\'t believe in science so the fact lefties do mean it\'s a religion?\n\nNo I straight up mean that you can be handed scientific documents and choose to ignore them because they don\'t fit your narrative.  \n\nOver and over and over this happens.  Get vaccinated and you won\'t get COVID.  Lie.  The vaccines are perfectly safe.  Lie.  COVID poses a significant risk to all demographics.  Lie.  Alternative treatments to COVID besides the vaccine don\'t work.  Lie.  Your kids are at risk of dying from covid if you don\'t vaccinate them.  Lie.  \n\nOver and over science is ignored in favor of narrative.  \n\nI\'ll even do one more that I\'ve never gotten an answer on.\n\nClimate Change.  If we\'re truly in a climate emergency and the world is going to end if we don\'t immediately do something then why are we not building nuclear power plants everywhere?  They are the safest most environmentally friendly means of energy production that has proven itself to cover all requirements for us to generate power.  The only carbon emissions come from the concrete used to build the building.  We have enough nuclear material right now to last us over 5 000 years and if we implement fusion we can literally generate power until the heat death of the universe.  The problems with spent nuclear material have been solved already and in numerous ways.  \n\nBut instead of taking the literal best solution we are instead investing billions upon billions of dollars into solutions that CAN\'T cover our energy needs.  You CAN\'T generate enough energy with wind.  You would need a solar farm the size of an entire state to cover energy needs and even then you\'d need a grid to support that.  These would need battery technology that hasn\'t been invented and there\'s no signs that it is even possible.  \n\nSo if it\'s climate emergency why aren\'t we treating it like one?,7

that\'s fair honestly. i think people are attaching too much political weight to sexuality/gender identifiers.\n\n i have to personally disagree on "lesbians like pussy and gays like cock" as an umbrella statement though  because whether or not a lesbian is attracted to female-presenting people or just women with that xx and whether or not a gay guy is attracted to male-presenting people or just men with that xy is a personal preference.\n\ni\'m a trans guy myself (who hasn\'t physically transitioned yet) dating a straight woman and if she considers herself straight while still being attracted to me because she sees me as a male (body and all) i don\'t think it\'s really my place to tell her she\'s not. if she *hadn\'t* wanted to date me for being trans because that\'s not what she\'s into that would\'ve been fine too.\n\ni agree that thinking not wanting to date someone for being trans is transphobic is ridiculous though. people can\'t help what they\'re attracted to and i think the emotional/social baggage alone that comes with being trans is a valid enough reason to not want to either way.,6

It was by and large conducted by individual doctors to unsuspecting patients they determined to be a draw on the health system.\n\nAs an analogy it would be like a city water inspector dumping weight loss drugs into the water supply on his accord.

I give him USMCA but I think the trade war has largely backfired if you compare what our goal was versus what has been "accomplished" (it\'s still too early to tell if phase one will actually be followed by both parties). Unemployment numbers are great but it doesn\'t tell the whole story.\n\nUnemployment numbers were already good going into his presidency what we needed in my view was a boost in wages and to address the growing labor shortage which was up to 3 million prior to the pandemic. He failed to address both actively making legal immigration harder.\n\nWhile he hasn\'t started any wars or gotten us involved in more I kind of expect that to change in a second term especially with the boiling point tension in the middle east rn. I also think his handling of current wars we\'re in has been adhorrent. I felt under Bush and Obama there was SOME goal to the wars (we\'re in Syria to assist Kurds and deter Russia Afghanistan to limit Taliban influence Iraq for ISIS) but now it\'s like...idk. He negotiated a deal with the Taliban without even going through the Afghani government (and that deal as you would expect was completely unreasonable and left the Afghani government out to dry). We abandoned the Kurds and apparently our stated goal in Syria now is to just defend oil fields in the East. Iraq has been weird because they flat out asked us to leave due to rising tension between us and Iran but we uh...refused to leave so idk man.\n\nIt\'s a shizz show. Additionally his healthcare platform is non-existent which is pretty scary for somebody who\'s on expanded Medicaid considering he\'s actively trying to kill ACA in the courts. Also I think his trade policy has been garbage aside from USMCA his big initiative outside of that is basically trying to get us back into the Trans-Pacific Partnership a deal he pulled us out of his first month in office.\n\nI think policy wise he\'s been pretty dang incompetent and sometimes flat out malicious. There\'s a reason he still brags about stuff like VA Choice which he didn\'t even sign lmao the man has a weak portfolio.\n\nHe knows how to work a rally crowd tho,0

You are acting like you don\'t know what it means but it\'s basically talking about Moses-based religions. Society based at least in practice on the provisions of Judaism and Christianity that are shared by both. We don\'t ban certain foods or enforce specific religious dogma but a lot of the basics in the 10 commandments and other biblical laws informed a lot of codified law in the colonies and later the US government. It doesn\'t mean that the ideas are unique to Judaism and Christianity as many other religions don\'t want people stealing or murdering but a lot of the shared tradition that was written into law (much of which thankfully has been removed from law as being archaic as well) stemmed from this shared tradition. We aren\'t specifically Jewish or Roman Catholic or Episcopalian but a mixture of the common denominators. It\'s a really simple concept to understand but very easy to "well actually" if you want to really badly on any single point.,8

"It's not just degenerate men either. More often than not it's lonely men.\n\nThe rise of social media has made dating increasingly difficult for men because it's allowed women to be increasingly selective with those they choose to spend their time with. Combine that with society becoming increasingly hostile toward men and masculinity (bonus points if he's white) and it's not hard to see why so many men are becoming detached depressed and lonely.\n\nSo many men are absolutely desperate for *any* connection at all. Enter OnlyFans. You could do a quick google search and see all the naked women you could ever want. *OR* you could find a particular woman who appeals to you send her some money and she'll send you a photo set sometimes taken just for you sometimes with a message and so on.\n\nThe parasocial relationship has been more and more of a thing recently. Desperate lonely men hanging around in twitch ethots' chats hoping for any kind of attention. Desperate lonely men throwing money at multitudes of OnlyFans models hoping for any kind of relationship no matter how small and artificial.\n\nThese men still have a choice mind you. I'm not going to pretend they don't. That's one of the biggest problems I have with feminists is that they treat women like helpless victims who literally don't have the ability to act like grown ups which to me is more misogynistic than anything they accuse the dreaded patriarchy of. But despite these men having a choice I still do feel terrible for the position they are in and how eager so many women are to exploit them.\n\nFeminists are pushing the idea that it's *empowering* for women to sell their body like this which is not only a problem for women themselves treating themselves as sex objects but it's a problem for men whose loneliness is being casually exploited for monetary gain by a society which increasingly doesn't give a shit about them.",8

Minorities didnâ€™t move in to take advantage of housing prices poor blacks moved up from the Deep South during the preceding decades to get jobs in a booming industrial hub and escape Jim Crow. They moved into the poorer working class districts but thatâ€™s what every new wave of immigrant workers does in a US city.  As long as there were lots of well paid factory jobs those cities kept growing and the black neighborhoods had low unemployment and normal crime levels.\n\nDe-industrialization basically destroyed the economic reason for those cities to exist (at least on the scale they had been built up to). As factories closed unemployment and crime rose and those with the means to move began to do so in huge numbers leaving abandoned housing and forcing local businesses to close. The worse it got more people would move out accelerating the problem. Federal policies subsidized suburbanization. The cities were gutted by urban renewal projects poorly conceived public housing and blocked investment in black neighborhoods.\n\nA lot of the same trends helped depopulate rural white areas like West Virginiaâ€”those with the means left and went to wealthier metros where there were more job opportunities.,6

">How would a company without the government enforce zoning laws patents or any other bullshit that drives up medical prices?\n\nYou are fundamentally naive about the US healthcare ecosystem. Not only were you ignorant of the collusion between Hospitals and Insurance companies on price fixing but also about the long time the AMA cartel discriminated against DO degrees and NP. Nurse Practitioners could also see their scope of practice expanded to better fill the role of doctors in rural communities which can drive costs down.\n\nGovernment doesn't do anything without consulting it's most influential and generous constituents. It's a big club and you ain't in it. The AAMC AMA Hospitals Insurance companies and Big Pharma write the regulation to benefit themselves. \n\nThe high prices of healthcare is simple econ 101 shit.

You have less doctors per capita every year while you have an aging population that is using more healthcare then it is no wonder healthcare costs have skyrocketed.

Is that not a reasonable skepticism to have when none of the actual data has been shown? Iâ€™m not saying thereâ€™s no chance itâ€™s including same sex parents as well but it seems like this is a case where a statistic could be used manipulatively.\n\nLike here I can give you a source right now that says children raised by same sex (male or female) couples fare effectively the same as those raised by heterosexual couples: https://aamft.org/Consumer_Updates/Same-sex_Parents_and_Their_Children.aspx\nIf the statistic about unrelated men being more abusive is to be believed when applied to gay men raising children shouldnâ€™t we see a difference in those numbers?\n\nLook the point of all this is if we want to understand where abuse to young boys is coming from so we can combat it we have to be real and not misleading about where itâ€™s coming from and what causes it.,8
>That law should be protested and changed but regardless that wasn\'t murder under the current laws.\n\nThen that\'s where we disagree. Brianna had nothing to do with the no knock warrant her boy friend did. Her death was absolutely unjustifiable and an example should be made of the officers who murdered her.\n\n>Believing your life is in imminent danger legalises deadly force as self defence.\n\nThat was a child holding a toy gun. If he as a police officer cannot deescalate a situation like that then he is not fit to be an officer and frankly not fit to roam free. And once again that does set a dangerous precedent where any officer can claim that they felt that they were in danger and therefore murdering a literal child was deemed appropriate. Maybe he really did feel that his life was in danger but that does not justify his actions. He should be arrested.\n\n>Very much moving goal posts\n\nGranted I made the false claim that he wasn\'t charged earlier but that doesn\'t change the fact that his accomplices weren\'t charged before the protests.\n\n>picking a case where an officer gets charged with murder and 3 other officers also got charged despite just bystanding rather than actively participating in the death is a weird example to pick for a "cops never get punished" narrative.\n\nOnce again had the public not protested the accomplices would\'ve got off scot free. The three bystanding cops wouldn\'t have been punished had the protests not happened that\'s a fact. And what do you mean "also got charged despite just bystanding"?! Standing around and watching your partner choke a man to death *while the man is audibly saying he can\'t breathe* is a textbook example of aiding and abetting a murder.

"As one person's story of becoming a Communist and gradually losing faith in it over time...\n\nI grew up in a poor and dysfunctional family - had to go to food banks sometimes to have enough to get through the month never got to travel that much aside from visiting family lost a lot of said family to cancer and other diseases before I was 10 among many other things. \n\nWhen I became interested in political issues I started out as a Communist when I was a teenager both because of my poor background and that it seemed like the most worthy ideal to strive toward. A world where people were free to do as they pleased while also working together to create a better and more prosperous society that could and would endure the test of time. A place where people wouldn't need to worry about where their next meal was coming from where hopefully everyone treated each other with respect and where no one was afraid to be themselves. \n\nSo I began reading as much as I could online and at my school's library about politics economics and communist theories since I wanted to build actual arguments to support my Communist positions. As time went on though and as I began to learn more and more I gradually lost faith in all forms of Socialism not just Communism. While I've revisited Socialist ideologies pretty regularly I've only grown more and more certain that Socialism as it was originally envisioned - that being a stateless society built on mutual cooperation en masse - is simply impossible for a myriad of reasons.\n\nWhen I was around 19 I was kind of depressed and begrudgingly supported Social Democracy despite how much I wished I could say I was a Socialist. That's when I started flirting with Anarchism and everything changed when I discovered Anarcho-Capitalism. While I am not an AnCap far from it discovering that ideology introduced me to people like Ludwig von Mises. Mises completely changed my entire outlook on Capitalism personally and as I began becoming familiar with others with similar views like Henry Hazlitt Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman - I grew to greatly support Capitalism. \n\nWhat's more is that I stopped looking at Political Theories and began looking at the practical application of economic policies and their results which is what has continued to drive me as a supporter of Laissez-faire Capitalism over any particular ideology. Why? Because I genuinely believe that Laissez-faire Capitalism is the best possible economic system for creating a society that is as happy and prosperous as it could be.\n\nThere's a lot more to my beliefs and how I came to them this has all been a summary but I actually plan on writing a book about my political beliefs sometime in the next few years to kind of piece together all the various parts of my political philosophy that I've built up over the past decade of my life into one cohesive and comprehensive ideology.",3

"A Libleft that's also a Marxist. Color me shocked...SHOCKED...well not that shocked. Your argument is based around the juvenile premise that life is unfair because in order to survive you have to actually try to survive. Sorry no sympathy from me there. \n\nYou use that premise to set up a lone false dichotomy. Work for this one company or die of starvation. That's it no more choices. Person has been forced into oppression by...nature...apparently. However in a robust economy there are innumerable choices to trade your labor for. Different jobs give different benefits and salaries. Competitors will compete for your labor if you have valuable (rare) skills. You get to decide where you work. It's a voluntary trade to maximize the ultimate profit for both parties. \n\nThe value of your labor is based off two things. The first is the value others derive from it and the other is how many people can also do your job. The rarer your skill set the more you can charge for your labor. The more common your skill set the less you can charge for your labor. Your subjective valuation of your own skill set means NOTHING. People work for others because it is their best chance to capitalize on their own labor. It's one of the reasons why so many people in the world flock to the US. Which is weird because why would so many flock to be slaves.../s\n\nWe actually agree on the utility and common benefits of forced taxation (theft). So kudos. Where I draw the line is when the taxes are used to do unconstitutional things that basically undermine my economic and personal liberty. The gov should use taxes for very strict purposes and limited powers. \n\nThe cartoon in it's simplicity actually illuminates an obvious falsehood of LTV. Your labor is only valuable if other people find value in it. It doesn't matter how much you value your labor or how hard you worked at it. If I were to dig a hole in the middle of the dessert for 2 days and for some reason valued it it would have produced ZERO value for others. So I wouldn't be paid...obviously. \n\nLTV has been proven bogus repeatedly. \n https://mises.org/wire/three-arguments-debunking-marx%E2%80%99s-labor-theory-value",1

If you want to insist on this then let\'s stop talking about ownership and start talking about assets for which people have rights of liability and exclusivity instead.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> They have all the rights; they\'re the sovereign. This controversy wouldn\'t exist if these people didn\'t have discretion. They write the laws and they can change the laws. That they\'re doing with your money what they decide (or decided at some prior point) changes nothing.\n\nIn almost all democracies there isn\'t a single sovereign. You have multiple actors checked and balanced against each other to prevent exactly the kind of thing that you\'re talking about. \n\nAlso if sovereignty is the criteria which makes you claim that the government owns that money then they own literally everything that they\'re sovereign over moron. Whether they\'ve already collected your revenue by taxes or not they have mechanisms to forcibly seize everything within their jurisdiction and therefore own it. It\'s only by their grace and apathy that you have any autonomy over the assets in your control.\n\nAnd you could say "_but if they already have the money it\'s easier to use it!_" except the mechanisms in both cases - asset seizure and using assets outside of their legal authority - would be exactly the same since "_the government_" isn\'t a single monolithic entity. If the central government wanted to requisition those assets they\'d have to seize them from other parts of itself.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> Your entire argument is that people if allowed to retain their money (and the rights of ownership associated with it) will do the wrong thing so it must be taken... but still you try to insist that the confiscated money is theirs?\n\n\u200bThat\'s not my argument we\'ve been over this. My argument is that the state is the best possible guarantor of redundancy in a nation and therefore that it\'s worth the marginal concession in autonomy in order to provide a minimum standard of living and prevent poverty after retirement.\n\nSomeone can still do the "_right thing_" and then get rug pulled or robbed or defrauded and this policy is also an insulation against abject poverty as a consequence of that.\n\nAs for the rights over their money that they lose it\'s literally just autonomy and:\n\n1. You don\'t have an unrestricted financial autonomy in the first place.\n\n2. Autonomy isn\'t even a defining characteristic of ownership.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> That\'s interesting because I see only monarchies in the private sector and yet it actually works.\n\n1. Private sector companies are only very rarely monarchies once they grow beyond a tiny size. Almost always the CEO is accountable to a board of directors and has a fiduciary responsibility to guarantee returns for shareholders (under threat of government intervention).\n\n2. It "_works_" in the sense that the market in aggregate is maximally efficient at optimising "_marketability_" of whatever products it produces. Individual companies start and fail all the time risky (and even safe) assets sometimes lose all their value people commit fraud literally all the time and the heads of companies come and go.\n\nWhen you want to maximise some other criteria at the expense of marketability (i.e. redundancy or minimum standards of service) then the government is **more** efficient than the free market.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> The problem I was highlighting is the conflict between "these people are too stupid to make choices that are in their best interest" and "these people through democracy are smart enough to make choices about government that are in their best interest." Transparency means fuck all when the exposed system is beyond the comprehension of the voters. Their votes (if cast at all) will belong to someone else... except under exceptional circumstances perhaps.\n\nWhen people make the decision to invest in themselves they discount the future too much and make poor decisions. When people make decisions about what should happen after retirement there are already retirees which factor into their decision-making (and retirees themselves are able to vote).\n\nAt the same time "_the more years you work the more compensation you receive_" makes a lot more sense to people intuitively than "_if you invest a tiny amount of money when you\'re 20 it\'s going to be worth a lot more than if you invest a lot of money when you\'re 60_". It\'s also much easier for them to interact with the levers (i.e. time worked rate paid pension paid out) than it is for a traditional portfolio.\n\nObviously all of this is beside the fact that a government pension looks fundamentally different from a private pension (because it exists for a different purpose) and rational intelligent people on their own might try to maximise a different criteria even if it introduces risk of poverty after retirement.,5

I have. My experience in the US is that itâ€™s very customer-centric with offices designed with paying customers in mind.

In the UK there has been a massive shift in the last 2-3 years in the standards for what we call bike lanes.

"> our government has an unbelievable knack for misappropriating funds\n\nThat happens with every government on Earth. Some funds won't be spent the way that every taxpayer wants.

Those $9 won't even go into a less efficient use for me like it could happen with taxes. That money just vanishes - poof! No matter how bad the American government is they just can't lose as much money on healthcare for instance as is currently lost by people having to pay some ridiculous overpriced insurance. I mean godammit even the Cuban regime was able to educate people with a full blown embargo taking money from I don't know where. If they were able to do it with pennies (their budget is $9.5 US Dollars per capita which is ridiculous) your much more functional systems will be able to do it with your millions.\n\nEverything you purchase has multiple forms of added costs.

But Iâ€™ll bet that if you follow the general principle of just playing nice and not saying anything derogatory most people will be a lot more relaxed. Sure you might disagree with being P.C.

Power means *a lot of things* and most people would agree that practicing racism requires exerting your power over someone else to *act* upon your prejudice. That means a lot of things â€” everywhere from violently harming someone to refusing them basic goods and services based on immutable characteristics they have no control over. Power comes in many shapes sizes and colors.\n\nAnd it transcends a white vs. black definition because it is applicable anywhere a community exerts their power to enforce their prejudice upon a people for their identity.

The War of 1812 started because the British violated the terms of the treaty that ended the American Revolution. They made illegal incursions into US territory blockaded American ports stole American ships and literally kidnapped and enslaved American sailors. The British treated the US like a wayward colony and wanted to use intimidation and strangulation tactics to cause the US to submit and hand over control of its territory back to the British Empire.\n\nThe US attacked the British outposts in North America as a response to hostilities started by the British in order to force them into renewed treaty negotiations in which the British would stop that and abandon their goal to regain control of their colonies in the US. It worked. The treaty that ended the War of 1812 specifically achieved US aims.\n\nBoth British people and Canadians have absolutely ass-fucked history regarding the War of 1812 to appease their modern anti-Americanism and cope with modern realities that cause them to be perpetually butthurt and insecure about their relationship with the US. They conform history to their modern biases. \n\nCanadians in particular are so brainwashed about the War of 1812 it\'s basically a masterclass in modern political propaganda. Canadians are taught that Canadians burned the White House in an American war of aggression which ended 50 years before Canada became a country. That\'s even though the British troops that burned the White House literally never set foot in what is now Canada. That\'s even though the US had already sacked York which was the British seat of power in North America essentially "Canada\'s" capital. That\'s even though "Canadians" literally didn\'t fight significantly in the entire conflict with the majority of fighting being between British Redcoats and American forces. That\'s even though if Canadians want to pretend they existed back then then by that logic the US defeated Canada in the American Revolution.,8

"It has more to do with the fact that those countries had extensive firearm registries from the get go and the number of weapons they confiscated was very small compared to the number of firearms in the US.\n\nFor example the UK banned semi-automatic centerfire pistols after the Dunblane Massacre in the early 90's. The amount of firearms they seized is equivalent to the amount of new guns Americans buy every 3 months.",6

Documents should be retroactively changed if you find out the information on them is wrong. If the doctors think a person has one disease but it later turns out to be another the records should be changed. Likewise if a "female" baby later turns out to have a male gender the record should be changed from F to M.\n\n...ignoring the fact that babies don\'t have genders in the first place.,6

The OGL was a capitalist move it was explicitly WotC imitating corporate embrace of open source software. The idea was that commercial third parties making D&D-compatible products would expand the market far more than WotC could on its own while enshrining WotC\'s product as the standard reference. And it was 100% correct.\n\nNow WotC feels tempted to seek rent on all that work and market systems are punishing it. Businesses that have been built on that foundation are preparing to fight a legal war if need be and the echosystem of content creators is coordinating the fanbase against it.\n\nSo complaining that "capitalism is killing D&D" is yet more braindead tripe by people who consoom product but somehow hate to think how product gets to them.,8

> edit:\n> \n> To elaborate on why skin colour really doesn\'t matter "races" as we know them don\'t exist on a genetic level all that exists is the genes that are responsible for skin color. These genes are adaptive and change a lot based on enviornment natural selection mutations and migration. They\'re also independent of the rest of your genome. This is why there can be skin colour change within a population. So skin colour doesn\'t mean there is a phylogenetic relationship between individuals. There\'s a shit ton of papers explaining this. From a scientific perspective skin colour isn\'t too relevant to genetics but it\'s still very relevant in life based on the cultural and socioeconomic implications it has.\n> \n> And also white people won\'t go "extinct" because even within populations that aren\'t white it\'s completely possible for the genetic mutations or environmental conditions that caused the evolution of white skin to make people whiter even if there is more mixed breeding. E.g people ethnically asian can be whiter than people ethnically white.\n> \n> https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/skin-color-is-not-race\n> \n> https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2016.0349\n> \n> https://muse.jhu.edu/article/48157/pdf\n> \n> https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajpa.20945?casa_token=EkMkizwTyOIAAAAA:t2LfdgS0Z58Rya5x7-jEwHjOHIDBgQERPf7Q5-MskYAlh8fqlvRzHK3CcZyG9wUbmbg5ruSWExsQUbI\n\nI don\'t have a lot of time right now but I just wanted to quickly refute a couple of your claims.\n\nFirst of all race is more than mere skin color. At the risk of doxxing myself I attended an [ASHG](https://www.ashg.org/) conference back in 2018 in San Diego - which is one of the largest annual meetings of the world\'s top geneticists. And one of the more interesting talks at this conference was given by Myers and Speidel from the University of Oxford. [Here\'s a link](https://eventpilot.us/web/page.php?page=IntHtml&project=ASHG18&id=180122753) to the presentation that they gave. I\'ll highlight their key findings from the presentation below.\n\n>Building genealogies for tens of thousands of individuals genome-wide identifies evidence of directional selection driving many complex human traits.\n\n>S.R. Myers 1 2; L. Speidel 1\n1) Department of Statistics University of Oxford Oxford United Kingdom; 2) Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics University of Oxford Oxford United Kingdom\n\n>For a variety of species large-scale genetic variation datasets are now available. All observed genetic variation can be traced back to a genealogy which records historical recombination and coalescence events and in principle captures all available information about evolutionary processes. However the reconstruction of these genealogies has been impossible for modern-scale data due to huge inherent computational challenges. As a consequence existing methods usually scale to no more than tens of samples. We have developed a new computationally efficient method for inferring genome-wide genealogies accounting for varying population sizes and recombination hotspots robust to data errors and applicable to thousands of samples genome-wide in many species. This method is >10 000 times faster than existing approaches and more accurate than leading algorithms for a range of tasks including estimating mutational ages and inferring historical population sizes. Application to 2 478 present-day humans in the 1000 Genomes Project and wild mice provides dates for population size changes merges splits and introgressions and identifies changes in underlying evolutionary mutation rates from 1000 years to more than 1 million years ago. Using our mutational age estimates **we developed an approach quantifying evidence of natural selection at each SNP**. We compared resulting p-values to existing GWAS study results finding widespread enrichment (>2.5-fold in Europeans and East Asians) of GWAS hits among individual SNPs with low selection p-values (Z>6) stronger than the 1.5-fold increase observed at nonsynonymous mutations and with enrichment increasing with statistical significance. **We found evidence that directional selection impacting many SNPs jointly has shaped the evolution of >50 human traits over the past 1 000-50 000 years sometimes in different directions among different groups** [i.e. human racial groups]. These include many blood-related traits including blood pressure platelet volume both red and white blood cell count and e.g. monocyte counts; **educational attainment** [a common proxy for IQ]; age at menarche; and physical traits including **skin colour** body mass index and (particularly in South Asian populations) height. Our approach enables simultaneous testing of recent selection ancient natural selection and changes in the strength of selection on a trait through time and is applicable across a wide range of organisms.\n\nIn other words we can now detect and analyze natural selection-driven divergent evolution in humans at every single SNP! And so the idea that we\'re all essentially the same at the genetic level is thoroughly-debunked leftist pseudoscience at this point. \n\nAnd one of the more interesting slides presented during this talk showed a long list of highly polygenic phenotypic traits that have already been studied and analyzed in each human racial group and those findings strongly pointed to *lots* of *recent* (i.e. the last 2 000 years - which is long after most human races diverged from each other and occurred within written history!) natural selection across all racial groups. There were tons of other talks at ASHG which covered very similar topics and most of them had very similar conclusions. Major advancements in AI combined with huge amounts of genomic data has made it very possible to now seriously investigate divergent evolution in humans - both within and between human racial groups.\n\nAnd not only can we detect divergent evolution in someone\'s DNA now but we can even *predict* many aspects of someone\'s phenotype based on their DNA alone - even when they\'re still embryos! For example as already mentioned above in Myers\' and Speidel\'s talk at ASHG we can now predict someone\'s academic performance from their DNA alone [[1]](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/04/05/598532.full.pdf)[[2]](https://youtu.be/FQU0PNYYSBQ). And even more disturbing for leftists [we can even predict someone\'s socioeconomic status from their DNA alone now as well](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/31/E7275)! \n\nAnd so even though the leftist-dominated media academic community and scientific community is still pretending that their environmental and social constructionist worldview is supported by science and the latest genetic evidence it really isn\'t! Major and recent advancements in genomic science have basically completely annihilated several of the core foundational pillars of the egalitarian left. The only reason why the scientific refutation of their worldview hasn\'t seriously affected them yet is because they still have so much institutional control and cultural momentum going in their favor. But that will eventually change once this information starts to become more widespread within academia the scientific community the media and the public in general.,3

Thatâ€™s only partly true. There is massive r&d costs and upfront construction costs to automate manufacturing facilities or any kind of facility. Automation also isnâ€™t ideal. We didnâ€™t have automated systems that can do visual inspection of components as quickly or as well as humans can. There are also failure points where humans are required to intervene to fix problems. Even a fully automated factory would still have plenty of people around. Itâ€™s just likely those people would have to be more high skilled workers.,7

Because we donâ€™t subsidize nuclear power like we do coal and oil.

"Agreed in theory that's what private insurance should solve by making the risk pooling voluntary.

I see what youâ€™re saying but itâ€™s pretty disingenuous to call a corporate oligarchy fascism.

Here is the wikipedia link: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%931919\n\n\nLook at the list of Marxist belligerents to the right. You can click on their profiles and check. 80% of them are Jews and I\'m pretty sure Jews only made up a fraction of a percent in Germany at the time like 0.25%. \n\n\nThey were over represented in Marxist movements and the leaders of those movements. That can\'t be disputed. \n\n\nHere is an article written by Winston Churchill in the Sunday Herald in 1920 when they took over Russia: https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Zionism_versus_Bolshevism\n\n\nIt was well known that Jews were behind Marxist movements at the time and both Jews and non Jews talked openly about this because it was just a plain fact. I can find plenty of sources of famous and influential Jews talking about the huge and disproportionate role of Jews in Marxism and Marxist movements and even boasting about it. Only after ww2 did this become a taboo "hate fact" and a big effort was made to cover this up to make the Jews look like totally innocent victims who were targeted for "literally no reason at all". That\'s what I was taught in school. And I certainly wasn\'t told about the US doing the same with the Japanese and all the other forces taking prisoners of war and commiting war crimes also.,2

If you mean via social benefits systems that\'s true the government has to use funds to supplement the level of automation currently in place because you still need individuals to buy the things produced for an economy to function and wages are way too low to allow adequate economic growth without it. \n\nThe problem though is that technological advancement will result in automation and redundancies over time there\'s not a way around this other than very strict regulations on automation (increases the price of goods on the world stage so that\'s not practical option for a "successful" economy competing with others that do) or implementing a new form of wealth distribution. (UBI/socialism) \n\nEventually probably around the time self driving cars/self service checkouts/AI call centres become the norm in 10/20 years time is when the effeciency of the system begins to become it\'s own destruction without previously mentioned adaptations.\n\nAs a side note though the lobbying is not what results in the automation or the effeciency that\'s the market pressure of competing companies/countries:\n\nLobbying and price fixing etc. as a whole delays the effeciency of the system by the reduction of competition as a result automating the system is not as profitable because the labour costs are kept artificially low via manipulation. \n\nThis delays job losses (its why people argue you can\'t raise the minimum wage without this happening not realising it just delays the inevitable) because the costs of implementing it doesn\'t make financial sense yet as it costs a shit ton to implement rn but that will change as the costs of it lower over time.,6

The laws of Christianity particularly the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church exist in documents outside the Bible. These laws very much describe Imperialism (I can say this for the Roman church at least but I donâ€™t know enough about the Eastern church).

Such a central religious and secular authority does not exist in Islam.,0

Well exactly his whole thing is about how the things you say are only worth listening to to the extent that you are well put together and not struggling to remain functional in your own life.\n\nThe elephant in the room that his defenders are pretending to not notice about these criticisms of him is that it\'s nothing but taking his own standards and throwing them back into his face.\n\nIt\'s like mocking an anti-gay preacher who was found to be secretly frequenting male prostitutes even though you\'re not anti-gay yourself.

It\'s not supposed to be wet ok?" He speaks quickly. "You said yourself. Hypothetically if the vaginal cavity was at some point wet it\'s most likely a sign of yeast infection cervical cancer or some other genital issue like an STD. Unless you\'re menstruating or using the restroom your vagina should not be \'wet\' in any form."\n\n\nYou bite your lip. "So why would we need lube? Why do you keep asking ok? You see you\'ve given me the facts. As a doctor you said scientifically speaking that the vagina should not naturally be wet. Why would you even think of artificially giving it that texture." \n\n\n"OK..." You say quietly just to keep him from going on. "You\'re right." \n\n\n"See? You\'re being an irrational woman. You need to get over your emotional illogical thinking process. Being a doctor I thought you were above that superior to most others." You don\'t reply. \n\n\nHe furrows his brows and slowly penetrates you. It hurts as it goes in. You\'re still aching from last time. You don\'t remember a time you didn\'t ache after sex with him. \n\n\n"Oh yes baby " He groans and keeps pumping into you. You close your eyes and hold your breath. "Yessss your p-word is sooo tight..! Oh my gosh..." He ejaculates a few moments later. \n\n\n\nIt was like this each time. You were never wet and never orgasmed. Still you put that all behind you.

Assuming from your flair you probably wish someone else took over like Trotsky or maybe bukharin. Trotsky would have made stalin look like an angel if you actually read into his ideology and itâ€™s implications of going to war with the rest of the world to spread communism right after the civil war through permanent revolution. The rightists under bukharin didnâ€™t have a unified plan that wouldâ€™ve prepared the country well enough to fight off the Nazis.\n\nBelieve it or not stalin was the moderate in a group full of ideologues who had spent years on the fringes of society and being deported to Siberia. With lenin dying suddenly after the revolution and the country left without their visionary leader. The situation couldâ€™ve been much much worse. Stalin was the best of a bad situation. He rebuilt the country just in time to fight against the Nazis and he didnâ€™t invade any European countries until 1939. Yes stalin and his government did a lot of bad things but he also lead the country through ww2 and saved the entire Slavic peoples from annihilation. The utilitarian in me says better 800 000 executed 2-3 millions dying in gulags or deportations and 3 million dead due to famine caused by a mix of bad weather and a brutal uncompromising collectivization program leading farmers to burn their grain than 200 million soviet citizens murdered by the Nazis as fucked up as that sounds and I definetly prefer that than Trotsky launching world war 2 barely a decade after ww1 losing causing millions of deaths and making communism instead of nazism the great evil of the 20th century in the popular imagination,2

>This most recent development the idea of gender as something independent of sex is one that unmoors the term from its foundation.\n\nI don\'t see how. If the Latin root is a word which has nothing to do with sex then divorcing the modern English word from the concept of sex doesn\'t seem to bring it any closer or farther from its beginning. \n\nMaybe it\'s unmooring it from its middle. But even then it\'s not that the modern concept of a gender identity is brand new. "Male" meant both "has a penis" *and* "has a male gender identity" historically--people just always made the assumption that those things went together and didn\'t have separate phrases for them. But they were happy to say things like "be a man" right? That phrase doesn\'t make any sense if maleness was purely a function of ones genitals and had nothing to do with how one behaved.,1

The argument is that you canâ€™t pick and choose what you fact check and what you let go because youâ€™re toeing the line between a publisher and a platform which have different legal protections. Agree or disagree with it at least understand the argument.,1
Yellow is the more memey extreme modern libright aka "legalise recreational nukes to amuse me and my genetically engineered catgirl wife and daughter" and purple is more old fashioned reasonable boring Anglo-European \'Classical Liberalism\' with historical British political figures such as John Locke and Adam Smith important for the historical development of Western society but no fun on the internet and largely non-American. Purple is usually the position of your moderate-right parents if they\'re not hard conservative but weren\'t hippies back in the 60s.,7

"While I understand that in your case it wouldn't be the best option yours is a fairly uncommon situation if you think about it. Of the percentage of people with citizenship of a given country that work abroad temporarily while retaining citizenship of the original country and who have kids in the original country and so on. I think the solution to that would be that people who work only temporarily overseas but retain a permenant home and permenant citizenship in the original country get a vote but anyone who resides permenantly and/or does not reside for work reasons in another country don't get a vote. \n\nFor example in the UK you get fuckloads of retirees who go off and live in Spain til they die they shouldn't get a vote in the UK because whatever happens in the UK doesn't affect them but they should get a vote in Spain because it affects them because that's where they live. Of course that doesn't make sense if they don't pay taxes in Spain because that's taxation without representation in the UK and representation without taxation in Spain for them but I assume (though I don't know) Spain has some kind of retail tax that they're subject to and maybe some kind of solution could be worked out with transferring their pension to be in Spain or maybe they just pay the taxes on their pension to the Spanish govt at the rate they would in the UK or whatever whatever. \n\nThe point is if someone stays in another country for good then the elections in their home country essentially no longer affect them and they shouldn't get a vote.",0

The problem is "Go woke go broke" is just wishful thinking on the part of normal people.  The reality is that the studios no longer have to worry about silly things like viewership.  Their cultural propaganda shows are bundled along with every other show on their streaming service.  They get paid whether you watch it or not the only thing that matters is that you\'re subscribed.  The only way you can "hit them where it hurts" is to cancel your subscription which is an extreme step that cuts off a big fraction of what\'s available for you to watch.  Most people won\'t do that.  \n\nAnd separate from that they\'re also being paid with woke capital ESG money to produce media with the right messaging.  So that\'s supplementing any losses that may be associated with silly things like "nobody wants to watch this crap."  \n\nThese people are true believers.  There\'s no cynicism behind their actions and they\'re not in it for the money.  They honestly think that they can erase the current problematic culture as if it were a giant hard drive.  They\'re going to reformat it and install a new cultural operating system whether the dirt people like you and me like it or not.,7

"A dirty secret you'll never see left wingers talk about is how much left wing politics inspired the Fascist movement. They didn't like Socialists and dividing people by class lines and abhorred revolutions like the Russian Revolution but they didn't like Capitalism the banking system and the pursuit of profits. If you look up the tenets of the Nazi platform it's obvious there was plenty of Socialist influence on their economics. They changed a lot of their rhetoric to get the business owners on board with them in the 30s to sound less anti business. I'm seeing a lot more anti Capitalist rhetoric starting to formulate with the Tucker Carlson's of the world now that they realize big tech companies have them by the balls.",1

After years of therapy to confirm that yes that is what they want. Hormone blockers are an emergency measure in very few cases but HRT *never* is. There\'s even a [woman in Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Petras) who started HRT at 12 because she figured out her brain was female at age 2. It took about 8 years of therapy and work with psychiatric professionals before they approved her for HRT that young. At that point they knew it wasn\'t "just a phase."\n\nYou will also note that though Kim Petras did manage to get gender reassignment surgery at 16 she is an outlier and she doesn\'t regret it one bit. By law in Germany there\'s no "dick chopping" under the age of 18.\n\nIf you think children are too young to make such decisions I will remind you that you figured out your sexuality at the age of seven at the latest. Probably way earlier. Kids absolutely can and do know things about themselves and we really should trust them more.,6

You\'re making the crass presumptions here that I\'m advocating for an Ethnostate something I nor pre-Modernist authrights stand for. I personally believe in cultural sovereignty and hegemony not racial hegemony but even so I will make an intellectual exercise and defend the point of post-Modernist "ethnostate" here.\n\n"Cultural enrichment" is a gross myth. In terms of culture transcultural interactions are desirable and an exquisite opportunity for these exchanges but it doesn\'t require demographic shifts or de-valuation of previous cultural conceptions like "enrichment" infers. And even so there\'s nothing particularly vile and non-enriched with having a single culture in a single place. I\'d argue that melting gold and silver together doesn\'t enrich gold nor silver but makes both imperfect.\n\nEverything you mentioned from the myopic world view to the technological backwardsness and your concept of "human progress" is pretty opinion based and has very little confirmation in the real world. Of course the interaction between civilizations beckon technological exchanges but after the Scientific Method was development there\'s no real damper to technological evolution that technical capacity investment and availiability of knowledge.\n\n>The problem with ethnostate is that you run out of minorities to oppress  so the country implodes because you start oppressing "regular citizens"\n\nYou have a really novelistic and Orwellian view of authority which is not surprising for the flair. I have a very Hobbesian view of savagery so I could not be one to say.,3

Considering that [2400 law professors signed a petition for Kavanaugh not to be confirmed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/03/opinion/kavanaugh-law-professors-letter.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage) I\'m gonna go ahead and confidently say that his vetting probably should have been at least a little more rigorous. It\'s interesting though that you use Merrick Garland as a point of reference for Kavanaugh\'s reputability though -- the would-be Obama appointee that never saw the Senate floor because McConnell refused to allow Obama to appoint a judge before his second term ended. It\'s almost as if Gorsuch should then be considered permanent damage to the Supreme Court if we\'ve now set the precedent that an "election year" is good enough reason to postpone the confirmation of a presumably reputable judge [who after all is apparently cut from the same cloth as Kavanaugh] but that an *ongoing impeachment inquiry* isn\'t good enough reason to be skeptical of a president\'s appointee to the highest court in the land. Crazy how it works out that the president who ended up with both the confirmed appointees here is the one with the same letter next to his name as the Senate Majority Leader.,0

Sorry for wall of text I\'m trying to substantively engage and flesh out my thoughts. \n\n>He might be a manager. Does his constitutional rights go away if he is?\n\nIf he is acting in a way that coerces employees under him to participate yes. If anyone feels like this will be held against them it is wrong to do this. It is an implicit endorsement from the state if it goes on as he is a representative of the state with some authority over people. Not only should it be illegal it is also very unethical.\n\n> Should a teacher be banned from wearing a iron maiden shirt because the students might feel they need to like that band?\n\nIf the teacher is leveraging Iron Maiden in a way that makes students feel they need to like it to get good grades. Yes ethically the teacher should abstain from coercing their students to act a certain way in order to achieve academic merit.\n\n>There is a power dynamic but it\'s irrelevant. Unless he tries to pressure them he has done nothing wrong.\n\nThis is true however in the situation mentioned the coach did not behave in a way where this was the case. Public prayer sessions with the whole team on the field... There are coercive elements here... The players themselves said so. If he asked them to suck his dick I think you would agree here even if he was like "No Pressure " the kids would still feel pressure. And there would be pressure. It frankly is also very disrespectful to the players who want to abstain but don\'t out of fear of retribution.\n\n>If a teacher is gay. Do they need to keep quiet about having a husband. Even if they don\'t talk about it at school. But simply have their husband pick them up at school. Or attend a private event with the husband. Because it might pressure the students to be pro lgtbq in the classroom.\n\nI don\'t think a student should be punished academically for holding any political views. But would you condone no punishment if they vocalized those views in a blatantly disrespectful and disdainful way? I\'ve gotten detention simply for talking back.\n\nI view this as similarly if there was an interracial couple and a student accosted the teacher as a race traitor. Or if the teacher is just black and a student calls her the N word.\n\nIt\'s not the same thing to equate these two. For the record if a player went up to the coach and was very rude and unreasonable about his faith I wouldn\'t have a problem with the coach disciplining the kid for it. Would you?,0

This is one of those rage bait tweets. Theyâ€™re deliberately written to be short while using words like â€œwhitenessâ€ that people that already agree with her will understand in a larger context and infer a broader meaning from it while those that donâ€™t know how/why sheâ€™s using â€œwhitenessâ€ will see this and get pissed or call her out. Itâ€™s like that â€œwhite lives donâ€™t matter â€¦ as white livesâ€ tweet from that college prof a few years back. \n\nItâ€™s all a weird combo of trolling ego tripping and virtue signaling. They say something like this not necessarily to piss people off like rightoids when they troll but to get you to engage (ie disagree with her exact language) so they can show off their own comparative knowledge of some niche academic terminology and tell others why they are wrong and therefore morally bad.\n\nBasically she is right. IQ tests are pseudoscience bullshit and donâ€™t measure anything. They may or may not translate well across cultures and donâ€™t account for education differences between those who take them. Her use of â€œwhitenessâ€ likely describes the fact that white people are on average wealthier and better educated and thus do better on IQ tests so the way sheâ€™s using the word â€œwhitenessâ€ just means that they are only measuring how white people have more access to education and not that white people are actually smarter. Also thereâ€™s probably some shit about cultural dominance thrown in there for good measure. \n\nBut instead of just saying this like a normal person she engages in wee bit of tomfoolery at your expense (congrats on getting this far through a wall text of Mr. Rightoid) and gets to feel smug about it.,6

>They just want to be able to speak their politics without losing their job.\n\nTo implement this you would have to regulate corporations to mandate that they cannot fire people for the speech that they say or do. This is super anti capitalist. A corporation is there for 1 thing; make money. If something internal is affecting that the corporations should be able to fix that.\n\n>For example I know a guy who got fired for posting â€œAll Lives Matterâ€ on his personal social page During 2020. Most people for freedom of speech would ague that he shouldnâ€™t have been fired from his profession due to talking about his personal beliefs thus not having consequences to his speech.\n\nThe "All Lives Matter" response is super cringe as it mostly just outs the guy as uninformed but he shouldn\'t have been fired...unless it affects his corporation\'s bottom line or affects hours on the clock. I personally am not for regulation of corporations like that. I do think that maybe they get regulated to not get access to your after hours activities to the point that it affects your job. Though hopefully he got unemployment until he found a new job.,8

â€œThatâ€™s just bizarre as fuckâ€\n\nCorrect. That is the only thing stopping the government from doing it. Not that it isnâ€™t able to or that it would trigger some catastrophic hyperinflation crisis.\n\n[Hereâ€™s a couple little secrets that people who talk about the debt never really speak about:](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124#toc-two-types-of-national-debt)\n\n1) US National Debt has been paid off continuously\n\nHow? Because the debt isnâ€™t like a credit card balance that we just never pay back. Itâ€™s the sum total of all the active US Treasury securities that people have bought.\n\nThose individual treasury securities expire on set dates and when they do that debt has to be paid back in full regardless (and it always is).\n\nThe reason the debt keeps going up isnâ€™t because we canâ€™t pay itâ€™s because *people keep buying new treasury securities*. Everyone is practically begging to loan the US money at all times because they know the US government can *always* pay.\n\n2) The largest holder of US National Debt isâ€¦ The US government.\n\nAround 41% ($13T) of the $31 Trillion US national debt is owned directly by the US government or the Federal Reserve. To repeat nearly half of Americaâ€™s government debt is owed to itself. There is zero chance that debt will ever be called in.\n\nWhen viewed through that lens the â€œrealâ€ US national debt is around $18 Trillion with about $7.4 Trillion of that held by foreign accounts.,8

> making an observation about how normal people are hypocrites.\n\nOnly if you strip out all context.  But the statement "Criminals are often returned to society because of forgiving judges. This has to stop." clearly shows that he doesn\'t believe there are too many people in prisons and actually wants to *increase* incarceration.  This is literally the main complaint about the crime bill.  It\'s hypocritical to agree with Trump\'s statement but criticize the crime bill for the same thing.,4

I see. Well Christianity wasn\'t the first Theist religion regardless. Even if the concept of rights requires a higher power specifically of the divine variety the Jews would have it first and before it the polytheistic ancient religions that came before it. Others may claim human rights come from the state their king etc. Others from a deist "god" that is simply nature. Christianism may be the most popular religion today but Gods were things far before them as were entities higher than the individual who may \'grant rights\' upon them.,6

Ok. Please tell me how most of what America has done isnâ€™t involving oppression and slavery in different forms. \n\nSome good things have been done yes. But most of those were the undoing of oppression or slavery based actions. \n\nChattel slavery was in effect for half of Americaâ€™s existence most of American territory comes from genocide of the independent peoples here. Slavery is still a thing in prisons which made the war on drugs even more morally bad. Women are still second class citizens who have men make their choices. \n\nWhen AIDS was just a â€œgayâ€ disease people were ok with it existing. \n\nThe minimum wage is suppressed to oppress the lower classes which is why benefits are tied to jobs as well. Thatâ€™s also where the â€œforefront of reasoningâ€comes from.,6

> I don\'t understand this at all. DW is absolving themselves of any and all risk\n\nNo. The risk is that they pay to market his content produce his merch fulfill his merch orders find him sponsors and pay the employees needed to do all those things. Crowder wanted to keep his own production team but under normal circumstances they\'d take the risk on a production team too. If crowder brings in less money then all that stuff still needs to get done but it\'s on DW to keep the ball rolling. Crowder still gets paid albeit less than he normally would and DW takes a loss while new sponsors are being found.\n\n> That\'s like giving a contract to a basketball player and saying if they don\'t make 20 points in a game you don\'t get paid.\n\nSorry to break it to you but that\'s exactly how it works. If players don\'t perform they can and will get cut. Here\'s a snippet from Arian Foster\'s 2012 contract with the Texans. "In addition during the period any salary cap is legally in effect this contract may be terminated if in Clubâ€™s opinion Player is anticipated to make less of a contribution to Clubâ€™s ability to compete on the playing field than another player or players who Club intends to sign or attempts to sign or another player or players who is or are already on Clubâ€™s roster and for whom Club needs room.",5

> Trump literally said "I\'m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists â€” because they should be condemned totally."\n\n> You\'re welcome to spread a hoax but it makes you an idiot.\n\nYou\'re taking his words out of context.  [Here](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/15/full-text-trump-comments-white-supremacists-alt-left-transcript-241662) is the full thing (which includes the part you quoted):\n\n> TRUMP: Oh no George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down â€“ excuse me. Are we going to take down are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? Okay good. Are we going to take down his statue? He was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue? You know what? Itâ€™s fine youâ€™re changing history youâ€™re changing culture and you had people â€“ and Iâ€™m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally â€“ but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now in the other group also you had some fine people but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats â€“ you had a lot of bad people in the other group too. \n\n> REPORTER: I just didnâ€™t understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly?\n\n> TRUMP: **No no. There were people in that rally and I looked the night before.** If you look they were people protesting very quietly the taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee. Iâ€™m sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day it looked like they had some rough bad people neo-Nazis white nationalists whatever you want to call â€˜em. **But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest because you know I donâ€™t know if you know but they had a permit. The other group didnâ€™t have a permit.** So I only tell you this: there are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country. Does anybody have a final â€“ does anybody have a final question? You have an infrastructure question. \n\nThe people who were there "the night before" and who "had a permit" were the ones chanting "Jews will not replace us".\n\nYou\'re right that rather than saying "they were white supremacists and they were good" he\'s denying that they were white supremacists at all; but I don\'t see how that\'s a defense.\n\n> Feel free to link the tweet where he said it all I could find was at a speech to a bunch of rich people where he was contrasting himself with with Elizabeth Warren.\n\nI think a lot of his old tweets are no longer up but [here](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/donald-trump-jewish-americans-democrat-disloyalty/index.html) is a contemporary news story.,0

In fact Iâ€™m a miscegenatist because my wife and her familyâ€™s shared faith matters waaaaay more to me than color,7

I\'d have to give the answer: "Similar in some ways different in others."\n\nFurther west you go the more spread out your cities get for a variety of reasons.

I\'ve been to west coast cities and Washington DC but not to east coast cities like New York.\n\nThe truth is probably somewhere in the middle like it usually is and I just don\'t think the benefit of living near millions of other people in the way US cities are structured is worth it. Far better to find a smaller place with only a few 100k people.,7

That\'s a very specific example that doesn\'t fit the european gypsie context and goes beyond the issues at hands. Living like a gypsie means stealing scamming begging. There is literally no other way to make money if you are homeless going from city to city.  Yes you have to stop that to not be prosecuted. They are not driving around with mac books and vanhomes makeing cash on the crypto market. In Germany for example they are usually pickpocketing and collecting "donations" for the blind/deaf on trains and other public transportation.\n\nA comparision to native Americans doesn\'t work because the default state for native Americans is a) artificially set up by society b) forcing children to grow up and live in native reservations where they are at a high risk of domestic violence sexual abuse and brainwashing is fucked up too anyway so you won\'t find an ally in me there.

Leaving home\'s inevitable creating an OF isn\'t.\n\n"Simply leaving your home contributes to a larger increase in the chances of getting harassed." is a clear fact. Your logic was nothing more than OF increases the risk of this happening. I don\'t think that I even made a comparison. Simply applying your logic to this situation results in absurdity. So what else is there about OF spesifically that implies a connection to getting harassed that isn\'t absurd logic? Inevitability? How about going to the gym? That\'s not inevitable and it\'s also a choice she made that led to a larger increase in risk of this happening than having an OF.\n\n>>Then the entire rest of your comment has nothing to do with OF. Sounds like your real argument is that complaining on the internet about being harassed is somehow comparable to N Germany.\n>\n>If you push for censorship \n\nI would only push for shaming on social media and getting kicked out of the gym so we can just agree and move on from all this about censorship. \n\n>It\'s the most likely scenario although the other highly likely one would be the guy approaching. The State should never be able to prohibit communication between people nor can it make laws forbidding people from looking around them.\n>\n>>Let\'s say the only thing the creep did was exactly the three items listed in the post. Then what? Does you argument rely on ignoring 2/3 things?\n>\n>That doesn\'t make sense because I\'m not ignoring anything I\'m simply presenting the most likely scenarios and explaining why it\'s absurd to complain about this sort of thing. Again it\'s already absurd without the complaining putting themselves at risk when they do it\'s even more ridiculous.\n\nWhy is that the more likely scenario? Couldn\'t you just as easily say it\'s most likely she is lying and then your argument can ignore all 3 items? I read a story the other day where it was like that so if we are not trusting her that seems just as well.,0
"You're so funny stating something in direct agreement with my claim and then concluding I'm wrong.  \n\nSmaller vehicles have significantly less wear on roads than trucks *exponentially* less so which is exactly my point.  \n\nNow consider the difference in weight between personal vehicles and heavy transport and go the other way back down to bicycles. If passenger vehicles have acceptably negligible impact on road maintenance (in your opinion) and vehicle wear on roads is exponentially proportional to vehicle weight (which it is) scale that relationship back down to a 300lb fat guy on an e-bike. That's as close to actual zero wear as can exist right behind basic foot traffic.",8

Sweden was more somewhere inbetween an absolute monarchy and a constitutional one seeing as the nobility held powers that were unseen in other absolute monarchies.\n\n>Won the war lol\n\nFair.

1) The amount couldâ€™ve been negotiated and Crowder couldâ€™ve opted to use the Daily Wireâ€™s resources for stuff like production and security. It seems like DW didnâ€™t put this in the term sheet because Steven likes to product his own shows. In which case he should have brought that up and had a separate clause to have that all funded somehow.\n2) If they parted ways Steven wouldnâ€™t become any less relevant. Anyone who likes Steven for Steven would still follow him and he can easily run marketing himself after his contract expires. DW wouldâ€™ve only made his reach even bigger. \n3) The penalties couldâ€™ve been negotiated. Crowder couldâ€™ve asked for them to sum up to 100% or less instead of 150%. This is how business works you start with an offer that may not be great for the other side then you negotiate. Itâ€™s not because you donâ€™t trust them itâ€™s because you know theyâ€™re going to ask for more when they can. \n4) I disagree with you calling the reaction immature. The DW has been nothing but mature IMO. They claimed responsibility for the contract because they wanted to be transparent. It doesnâ€™t do anyone any good to speculate about who wrote the contract. In all of their responses they were incredibly kind to Steven and gave him the benefit of the doubt even going so far as to say that he is a great guy and that every conservative should subscribe to mug club. Remember they were friends with him before all of this happened. I think what really ticked them off was the fact that Crowder tried to spin this into a promotion for mug club and also recorded his conversations with Jeremy KNOWING that he wanted to use it against DW. That is despicable IMO and a betrayal.,1

"Yea i think so. Shit had me cracking up because even if Bernie won congress is in charge of the budget and that would not fly at all lmao. I have a different copy pasta about bernie tho so whoever makes it down this thread enjoy:\n\n>To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bernie Sanders. His politics are extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of Democratic Socialism most of his policy positions will go over a typical low-information voter's head. Thereâ€™s also Bernieâ€™s revolutionary outlook which is deftly woven into his platform- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Castro's policies for instance. Millennials understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of his legislation to realize that theyâ€™re not just renaming a post office- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bernie Sanders truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldnâ€™t appreciate for instance the humour in Bernieâ€™s existential catchphrase â€œMillyuhnares and billyuhnares â€ which itself is a cryptic reference to Marx's epic Das Kapital. Iâ€™m smirking right now just imagining one of those establishment simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Bernie Sanders' genius wit unfolds itself on their Twitter feeds. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚\n\n>And yes by the way i DO have a Bernie Sanders tattoo. And no you cannot see it. Itâ€™s for the ladiesâ€™ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they don't just vote with their vaginas beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ðŸ˜Ž",0

1. Cult of tradition obsession over iconography and spiritual thinking.\n\n2. Rejection of modernism and rationalism.\n\nThe radical leftâ€™s reactionary rejection of our modern egalitarian society for a more traditionalist outlook on race and gender up to and including segregation (like we saw in CHAZ) Iâ€™d say check and check. \n\n3. Cult of action for actions sake.\n\nLooking at the climate activists in Europe such as just stop oil and the reactionary backing of legislations such as mandatory buyback for gun ownersâ€¦ check.\n\n4. Disagreement is treason.\n\nWeâ€™re on Redditâ€¦ check.\n\n5. Fear of difference\n\nAgain the creation of homogenous groups such as affinity groups show that the radical leftâ€™s view of race is steeped in outdated frameworks. Check.\n\n6. Appeal to social frustration.\n\nâ€œWorkers of the world unite you have nothing to lose but your chainsâ€ Check.\n\n7. Obsession with a plot.\n\nSee OPâ€™s meme. Check\n\n8. Enemy is both strong and weak.\n\nCheck I donâ€™t think I have to explain this one. Billionaires capitalists  and â€œfascistsâ€ are strong when the radical left needs them to be in the narrative and weak otherwise.\n\n9. Passiveness is trafficking with the enemy.\n\nâ€œWhite silence is violence.â€ Check\n\n10. Contempt for the week.\n\nThis one Iâ€™ll give a pass on.\n\n11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. \n\nCheck. Look at that Gabriel Gipe who said that â€œI have 180 days to turn these kids into revolutionariesâ€. He who controls the children controls the future and the radical left know this.\n\n12. Cult of machismo and weaponry.\n\nWhilst the original point exclusively speaks about the condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits the radical lefts progressive stack shows equal disdain towards standard habits. Not a pass but not a check either.\n\n13. The â€œvoice of the peopleâ€ is vetted in order to serve the state.\n\nâ€œAuthoritative sourcesâ€. Check\n\n14. Newspeak\n\nCheck\n\nNow am I calling the left fascist? No what Iâ€™m saying is that Ecoâ€™s definition of fascism is vague to the point that you could twist it to condemn any ideology.\n\nIf youâ€™re gonna call humans featherless bipeds donâ€™t be pissed when someone plucks the feathers out of a chicken to spite you.,8

Most good shows you are thinking of base much of their premises on core conservatives ideals.\n\nAvatar is a show entirely about self sacrifice in pursuit of living to expectations you never chose but were impingent apon you by broadly social expectations. For which the primary lesson leanered by Zuko is that masculinity is the capacity and willingness to stand in opposition to evil while carrying oneself with humility and humbleness.\n\nDude Zuko\'s character arch is "Christian masculine principles" 101. And Ang\'s is the beating heart of "choosing obligation over liberty".\n\nThe entire principles of honor duty deference to tradition run through many a work of good fiction because those mythical qualities are what make good stories. A lot of rebellion stories here and now simply offer a difference of deference. Take star wars where the empire is a relatively new imposition over galactic life in stark contrast to the way thing were before and the main character learns the skills needed to succeed by joining a distinctly anti-materialist religious order and adopting their principles and ideals.,1
The support for abortion almost always boils down to eugenics. \n\nThereâ€™d be a lot less suffering if we aborted poor peoples babies sure. Thereâ€™s also be a lot less suffering if we aborted mentally or physically ill ppl. We could eliminate entire diseases if we aborted the right babies. We could advance humanity hundreds of years in decades if we justâ€¦ kill off the weak and stupid. \n\nPerhaps we could even learn to identify the desirable traits of potential children and find a way to advance them inherently (crispr gene editing?) to exemplify the best traits of their parents before theyâ€™re even bornâ€¦. Oh wait thatâ€™s [Gattaca.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca)\n\nJokes aside youâ€™re right that this conversation has two sides worth considering but only one side is consistently conflated with eugenics. That should be enough for anyone to take a second look but the current political situation does not allow for reconsideration.\n\nAs I think you were saying the solution to childhood hunger is not killing the potential impoverished children but feeding them.,4

Your selection is backwards.\n\nThe shift in higher academia is real because academia has a political tilt. The VOLUME is at the lower end and the "lib" group is larger than the conservative group in the HS cohort. Effectively the bulk of "liberals" are STILL highschool graduates at best... or dead people.\n\nYes that but ALSO the lower someone\'s IQ the more likely they are to "hold liberal views".\n\nAlso we\'re still not actually discussing who they voted for. We also haven\'t defined "liberal" views in the context of modern parties.\n\nYou haven\'t made a point here you muddied the fuck out of the water. Good job asshole.\n\nEdit: \n\nHELL reading further you can see how that shit is shifting every ten years. In 94 it was MOSTLY conservative. If you can\'t see the political shifting there you\'re not paying attention. READ YOUR OWN FUCKING ARTICLE SHITWICK!,8
I mean it must be mis-souri-ble,7
The problem with this analogy is that the people â€œbreakingâ€ things arenâ€™t destructive outsiders but simply the majority of the country that has different values than this person. People should be under full rights to live how they want as long as that doesnâ€™t violate otherâ€™s free will. I understand that they feel that mainstream culture has gone in a direction they disapprove of but oneâ€™s exposure to that culture is voluntary.  If you dislike the environment of the area you live in then itâ€™s up to you to chose to either stay or move somewhere where you will be more comfortable. \n\nIn general I donâ€™t like â€œjust move lolâ€ as it can often be a lazy way to wave any criticism of a country/city/whatever but culture is different because itâ€™s just people acting as they want.,6

>I in fact  Think the real reason people hate liberals is because of neo liberalism. It has been used as a way to frame liberalism as something disgusting so real left wing people already have a stigma placed upon them before  even getting in a conversation.\n\nThat\'s where most of it comes from yeah. The other part is just that after years of watching corporate corruption pervert our democracy a lot of lefties have just lost faith in capitalism\'s ability to coexist with democracy all together and went further left as a result.\n\nThat being said letting fascists decide how to interpret the constitution for the rest of our lives is only going to cause massive problems for any progressive causes going forward. And we need whatever momentum we can get because when the climate crisis starts tearing this country up we\'re gonna be put at risk of going full ecofascist real quick to begin with. Also if Biden loses our "See? I told you so libs" is gonna get overpowered by their "Fuck you. This is your fault for throwing a temper tantrum" because neolibs control the media.,0
Tbf Dutch people know where to stand and where to look concearning the cyclist so I often only see tourists having trouble with the bikes. On the other hand Amsterdam is for sure a busy city with narrow streets that make it more likely for things to happen. Also because of the amount of tourists that arent used to having bicycles everywhere. In other cities though or villages or even outside of the very centre of Amsterdam the line between biking lanes vs pavement is very visible and practical and almost always there has been thought of safety and space !,6

"And he's managed to capture the hearts and minds of a significant enough portion of the populous to win the presidency at worst it's only negatively affected him very minimally but more likely it's been a significant positive. Even if it wasn't an active decision to talk the way he does it's worked so well that he became president. \n\nHowever you cut it and no matter how you feel about it perception of a candidate can be just as significant as their issues. When JFK and Nixon were running against each other TV was just taking off and the people who listened on the radio to the debate said Nixon won by a landslide where people who watched the debate on TV saw an extremely sweaty looking Nixon and a very put together JFK (in a pink suit!) and declared JFK the clear winner.

It\'s true that the end goal is the same however anarchists\' analysis of society and it\'s post-revolutionary implications differentiate them from us. Marxists claim that the state is organic. It will only wither away once class society has been eliminated. Anarchists claim that this is not the case and seek to abolish the state immediately after the revolution. Marx claimed that this was idealistic and that\'s why he kicked them out of the first internationale. Marx firmly believed that the "end goal" communism was not only possible but inevitable.,4

I worked for a hospital while this was all happening and due to all electives being shut down the only way to stay solvent and avoid layoffs was counting as many COVID patients as possible because the government was paying for them. So everyone was tested. Many came back positive even as they were dying of something completely unrelated.\n\nSo calling it more deadly given the fuckery going on around the counting the inaccuracy of the PCRs likely causing a lot more false positives and the complete elimination of flu deaths that first year is at best a bit suspect.,8

You are right in a strictly factual sense but for me it seems like enlightenment producing a workable results was more or less an accident not a direct consequence of the forces and thoughts that driven this enlightenment.

I\'m glad we agree on the 1200 not being enough for normal people lol. I have huge problems with the stimulus myself. I already linked what I thought would\'ve been better (I would have also been much more happy with a major UBI). I mainly took issue with the fact that you implied that the simulation the act of injecting much needed money into the economy right now was wrong. Also I would say that many businesses need help right now because the economy is stopped and if we just let them die it will be worse than if we didn\'t "bail them out" (although because it isn\'t really the companies fault coronavirus ruined the economy) because we don\'t want a depression. We want businesses to stay afloat so they can hop back to it when we start going outside again.

">There is a massive difference between what we were capable of understanding in 1974 and what we can understand now. All of the data collection and pseudo-AI algorithms are breaking down the complexities and apparent randomness of human behavior into quantifiable and meaningful data points for companies or political operatives or whoever else to use. You can say all of this is in it's infancy but it's not pseudoscience anymore.\n\nYour argument is literally based on the very assumptions which Hayek's lecture was arguing against. All such data pales in comparison to the information that individual people have access to when making subjective decisions on their own much of that information is not even in their conscious mind but comes from subconcious understanding of the world around them. The more advanced data science becomes the more Hayek's lecture is proven correct. Even the tiniest of missing variables can compound into gross miscalculations which was the lesson of Chaos Theory. The complete picture of society can never be analyzed by data scientists it is far too complex and is only contained collectively in the minds of every individual as whole. Scientists like Anthony Fauci look at human civilization and see only the veil of chaos and miss the hidden order lying underneath. They then presume that it is their job to play God and make decisions for everyone this is what Hayek meant by the Pretence of Knowledge.",1

Yes that is the objective of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie are supposed to be suppressed and their gains from the exploitation of labor are to be wiped out and employed to social ends. This is "theft" according to most moral models of "rugged individualism". The end goal of this persecution is ultimately the decimation of the bourgeoisie as a class because the reforms of the dictatorship of the proletariat will be employed to the ends of eliminating distinctions between owner classes and labor classes anyway. But in this also comes the challenge of assuring that the state does not develop its own in-groups which is why I am suspicious of a vanguard party (yet I have not read State and Revolution so of my precise criticisms of the vanguard I am not sure).,0

"There needs to be equity in the situation imo.\n\nBoth parties (the man and the woman) should have the choice to 'vote' on an abortion. \n\nObviously the woman has the final say but a man should be able to pay half the cost of the abortion fill out paperwork and dip rather than being forced to pay child support for a child they don't want.\n\nLikewise there should some kind of option to incentives carrying the baby to term if the man wants the child but the woman doesn't. This is a razor-thin line though and I doubt there is an ethical way to do it.\n\nBasically there are three ethical endings:  \n\\- Both want the child  \n\\- Neither wants the child either an adoption (possible 'term compensation') or abortion that each pay half for.  \n\\- Woman wants an abortion man doesn't woman pays for the abortion  \n\\- Man wants an abortion woman doesn't therefore woman accepts sole responsibility for the child man pays half the abortion cost in good faith and is no longer liable.\n\nAll the power is in the woman's hands but at least the man gets an out which is something the doesn't exist rn.

>Theyâ€™ve already explained to you why this is not the caseâ€¦ \n\nNo they tried to explain why this specific bill would fall under reserved powers which I think was inadequate. They still havenâ€™t explained why a bill affecting the GRC criteria for Scottish citizens is something Westminster should use â€œnuclearâ€ actions to unilaterally block something which Scotlandâ€™s democratically elected legislative passed by a landslide majority.\n\n On top of that this argument of popularity hinges on the idea that the majority of Scots would be overwhelmingly opposed to this bill despite the SNPâ€™s policy agenda/manifesto for the most recent elections (general and regional) clearly stating that this Gender Recognition Bill was years in the works and something theyâ€™d pursue. If the majority of Scots voted for a party that quite literally says it will streamline the process for gender recognition why tf would I assume that these same people are opposed to the SNPâ€™s recent bill. \n\nBesides youâ€™re only trying to dispute my point about the SNPâ€™s popularity but your point about the SNP being unpopular and this bill being unpopular in particular is substantiated by *crickets*. Yâ€™all have nothing except the Daily Mail angrily writing several articles on the matter.\n\n>even the most controversial \n\nI expect them to support the publicly published manifesto of the party they voted for yeah. I donâ€™t really give a shit if Westminster finds that controversial though. Westminster finds a lot of things problematic but are we going to start calling every issue controversial because the government hates it? Is the HRA â€œcontroversialâ€ now? Fixed Term Parliament Act? At least Iâ€™m using electoral success to gauge public support. All you have are the views of one of the most unpopular governments in U.K. history. \n\n>Also you need a constitution\n\nThis I agree with. A codified constitution wouldâ€™ve prevented this fiasco but unfortunately the nature of parliamentary sovereignty in the U.K. means that a codified constitution could only be made if the existing system is permanently scrapped. Thatâ€™s not happening anytime soon do conventions and devolution is all we got.,6

I don\'t hold anything against small business owners and I\'m just saying that they literally are petite bourgeoisie by definition aka not proletariat.  I\'m not a Marxist so I\'m not going to divide this into "people I like and people I don\'t like based on this definition from the 1800s".  Even from a Marxist perspective his point on the petite bourgeoisie was not that they\'re the same as the industrial barons but that they often strive to expand their businesses to be like them (even if usually unsuccessful at it) and they politically often align with them: aka supporting looser labor laws lower taxes etc which in this case aligns with republicans more.\n\nI just looked at 2020 election data too and there still is a relation to income just a bit different and flatter than before.  Everyone bracket making less than 200k voted for Biden and 100k to 200k voted for Trump.  Over 200k was split.  In this case the working class still voted democrat.  I do agree that the democrats are fucking up and losing that base though.  The main difference compared to previous years is that people with bachelor\'s degrees but no graduate degree were now more likely to vote democrat than republican like in previous years.\n\nI think this article describes the "American gentry" pretty well too if you\'re interested.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/trump-american-gentry-wyman-elites/620151/,0

Because fucking commies are disingenuous as all fuck and never post it.\n\n>To be able forcefully and threateningly to oppose this party whose betrayal of the workers will begin with the very first hour of victory the workers must be armed and organized. The whole proletariat must be armed at once with muskets rifles cannon and ammunition and the revival of the old-style citizensâ€™ militia directed against the workers must be opposed. Where the formation of this militia cannot be prevented the workers must try to organize themselves independently as a proletarian guard with elected leaders and with their own elected general staff; they must try to place themselves not under the orders of the state authority but of the revolutionary local councils set up by the workers. Where the workers are employed by the state they must arm and organize themselves into special corps with elected leaders or as a part of the proletarian guard. Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated by force if necessary. The destruction of the bourgeois democratsâ€™ influence over the workers and the enforcement of conditions which will compromise the rule of bourgeois democracy which is for the moment inevitable and make it as difficult as possible â€“ these are the main points which the proletariat and therefore the League must keep in mind during and after the approaching uprising.\n\nRead the first fucking sentence. It\'s not about self defense it\'s not about protecting yourself. It\'s about forcefully and threateningly using the guns against people who do not wish to submit to communism.\n\nMarx saw guns as a means to an end nothing more.\n\nIndividual gun rights are incompatible with communism/socialism. Communism and socialism rely on the central tenant that the state (whether you call it "society" instead is a distinction without a difference) can provide everything you need.\n\nIndividual gun ownership says I may need to provide my own food and safety. If the state cannot provide you with basic food and protection how can it provide anything else it claims to?\n\nThis is why every commie in power ever has done a gun confiscation.

Except the vast vast majority of CSA victims (around 84%) are little girls and even in male on boy CSA cases most perpetrators arenâ€™t gay.

Many of these people donâ€™t consider pederasty to be â€œgayâ€ and thereâ€™s a running gag about how itâ€™s fine because little boys have the same physical features as conventionally attractive women.\n\nThe above is just one example but eh youâ€™d be surprised at how many straight people would indulge in such degenerate behaviour.

My centrist view...  \n\n\\- Climate change is real enough (based on good science) to be something worth considering\n\n\\- No the world won\'t end in your lifetime nor will the earth become "inhabitable" in the measurable future.\n\n\\- But it will likely result in significant geopolitical issues droughts and some major cities (and some small countries) becoming uninhabitable.\n\n\\- No socialism isn\'t the solution - that\'s just an economic system.  And no "profit" isn\'t the cause of global warming. \n\n\\-  Neither is "let the free market with zero regulation do whatever it decides" any semblance of a reasonable solution unless pervasive consideration for unaccounted externalities (like pollution carbon etc) are accounted for\n\n\\- On that note an international carbon tax system might help the problem a lot but would be difficult to negotiate.\n\n\\- Regional carbon taxes may be effective but have some (usually minor) economic side effects.\n\n\\- Ignoring the problem won\'t solve it\n\n\\- Technological innovation is a big part of the solution and governments have SOME ability to encourage this and push innovations in a greener direction.\n\n\\- Generally overt bans with future target dates don\'t work unless they\'re addressing very niche issues.  (California often tries to ban common things usually fails and has to walk back or redefine what they\'re banning)\n\n\\- Industry power generation and other business actions play a big part.  We can\'t only focus on cars and individual consumers though we can\'t remove that focus.  Each of those things is about a third of emissions.\n\n\\-,4

Trump enacted a travel ban for several middle eastern countries while he was President under the guise of terrorism yet most countries with 9/11 conspirators (Saudi Arabia in particular) were not affected meaning it's much more likely he enacted the travel ban out of racism again fascist.

Now youâ€™re just putting words in my mouth. I donâ€™t believe in white guilt and i actually think itâ€™s stupid to be ashamed of something you didnâ€™t do yourself. I was specifically talking about tha US and the West there are probably countries in the world where white people do get discriminated against but i donâ€™t think itâ€™s happening in the west\n\nAlso i for once agreed with tucker class is the ultimate divider. The rich people at the top donâ€™t really care that much about peopleâ€™s race. But to complain about racism against white people in western countries is just stupid. White people arenâ€™t being discriminated against systemically in those countries. Even though class is the main divider itâ€™s a plain fact that Aftican Americans and Native Americans have a much higher chance of being killed by the police. Iâ€™m sure if you put all ethnic minorities together and compare them to white people itâ€™s the same poverty rate. But as you said it yourself black people have a way bigger poverty rate which is linked to over 400 years of racism. Even today if you look at things such as the prison industry you can clearly see how theyâ€™re profiting off of locking up mainly african americans\n\nAnd that doesnâ€™t mean white people are the â€œoppressorsâ€ but white people are for the most part more privileged in the west than other ethnic groups. Thatâ€™s not to say that working class white people arenâ€™t also oppressed by capitalism but you canâ€™t completely ignore race either,6

2 things are different there one being that many democrats denounced any and all violence for the BLM riots the 4 major ones being Bernie Sanders (progressive Wing) Nancy Pelosi + Chuck Schumer (Congressional wing) and Biden (Executive nominee at the time).\n\nThe second difference would be what each of the violent rioters are rioting alledgedly for. One is a debunked conspiracy theory about the election being stolen(many different proofs with no evidence) that continued to gain fuel from their side. The other is police brutality and excessive force not being punished. *IE: one is actually a provable failure of government and the other is a conspiracy theory.*\n\nSo they might both be citizens chosing violence to voice their displeasure at government failing like it usually does but looking into the details theres a larger difference.,8

Part of it is the higher ups need to understand the cultural mindset of the place you\'re doing this to. That\'s why Afghanistan was a cluster fuck.

Ok let go through this:\nResponses to:\n\n1. It Is about its healthcare and its distribution as it becoming a right is directly tied to that.\n\n2.  That wasnâ€™t a bait but what can I do to stop you falsely antagonising others in-order to â€˜appearâ€™ to have some moral high ground. You argue a conflicting argument if you genuinely believe we should implement universal healthcare but not label it as a right. Sure the right may be labeled â€˜the right to maintain basic health standardsâ€™ etc. but such a right cant be achieved if a universal health program is not implemented. So your argument â€œyou assumed I donâ€™t support/believe universal healthcare can workâ€ shows your lack if understanding upon the requirements of making healthcare a right/not.\n\n3. Nice reference to the â€œStrawman fallacyâ€ when in-fact You attempt the exact same thing by assuming my motives of my previous comment. Also your attempt to seperate what you call â€œsocialised health careâ€ and the argument that it is not a human right is fundamentally flawed as you cant have one without the other. Universal health care (whatever you want to call it) is needed if one wants to make it a right.\n\n4. This is the biggest flawed point out of them all let me explain. You again attempt to seperate supporting/opposing universal healthcare from the supporting/ opposing it as a right respectively as they are fundamentally intertwined. You also Ironically criticise me â€œinstead of mocking me... have a genuine conversation insteadâ€ automatically assuming Iâ€™m not interested in further discussion. You also support this criticism based on the fact that I â€˜twist your wordsâ€™ when in actuality my point is very relevant to your opinion.,8
Never let your dreams be limited to your reality,8
Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others even those who resembled ourselves were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended perhaps they even believed that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.,0

**[Five-Year Plans of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-Year_Plans_of_India)** \n \n >From 1947 to 2017 the Indian economy was premised on the concept of planning. This was carried through the Five-Year Plans developed executed and monitored by the Planning Commission (1951-2014) and the NITI Aayog (2015-2017). With the prime minister as the ex-officio chairman the commission has a nominated deputy chairman who holds the rank of a cabinet minister.

Under this system businesses in India were required to obtain licenses from the government in order to operate and these licenses were often difficult to obtain. The License Raj was intended to protect Indian industry and promote self-reliance and ensure regional equality. Up to 80 government agencies had to be satisfied before private companies could produce something and if granted the government would regulate production.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5),4

Hello,1
I am by no means an expert on this but Iâ€™ll do my best.\n\nThe Catholic Church doesnâ€™t deny intimacy to anyone.  Sex and intimacy are similar but different things.  Christ had intimacy or closeness with His Apostles but He didnâ€™t have sexual intercourse with them.  \n\nThe Church teaches that sex has two properties unitive and procreative.  Unitive since it binds a husband and wife as one flesh (which is why Catholics are against divorce.) Procreative since all sex should be open to life (which is why Catholics are against contraception.) Sex between two men or two women is neither of those things.  It doesnâ€™t unite them as one flesh and it isnâ€™t open to life.  You can make the same argument as to why premarital sex is sinful as well.  It neither unites nor is open to life (in most cases.)\n\nNow before you ask about married couples that cannot have children the difference there is that  sex is unitive and would be open to life if it wasnâ€™t for other natural means.  The homosexual act can never be procreative.\n\nAll this being said it doesnâ€™t mean gay people are awful and deserving of scorn.  We should be kind and loving to them while also understanding that most of them live disordered lives.,7

My first apartment just 5 years ago was 595/mo in a pretty good neighborhood now the same apartment is over 1000 and has a ton of stipulations.\n\nCrime isnâ€™t what it used to be in the vast majority of the area so people are coming back.

Honestly the Republicans should be happy. As long as they win the runoffs in Georgia they still control the senate and have gained ground in the house.

Increased population density *does not* cause higher murder rates. Any correlation seen between population density and murder rates in the U.S is due to black people living mostly in the cities.

Except that those two states have literally JUST started using ranked choice. Maine has had two elections with it and Alaska just one. It takes time and numbers to shed the two party power structure. Even though these two states have more ability to vote 3rd party than others the two big parties are still backed by a national party that can pump money into ads campaigns rallies workers etc. It's still not a even playing field yet. And honestly a lot of people don't know or understand how it works yet and many probably continue to just vote for the Rep or Dem candidates only. As people get used to it new voters learn about the system and come of voting age and alternative parties start campaigning there more you'll see the domination of the two parties diminish over time.",0

I donâ€™t think the historical record supports the notion that â€˜nonwhites â€™ which here we should define as non-Europeans changed entire continents through their efforts at colonization during this period.

So if the counter-example is an ancient one I donâ€™t think it has merit.,6

**[Populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism)** \n \n >Populism refers to a range of political stances that emphasize the idea of "the people" and often juxtapose this group against "the elite". The term developed in the 19th century and has been applied to various politicians parties and movements since that time although it has rarely been chosen as a self-description. Within political science and other social sciences several different definitions of populism have been employed with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5),4

They pass a bunch of laws and regulations that are ambigious or even contradictory with little guidance on how to implement it and don't give additional resources to help agencies implement it. This creates a ton of more work and headaches for the limited number of staff because it's the same number of people dealing with an ever increasing number of regulations (which further encourages turnover among the staff).\n\nThen again I worked in a science-oriented Federal agency in a group dealing with regulations...instead of some random local/state government position so I guess I was actually surrounded by smart and competent people.",4

It is a fallacy. A valid slippery slope argument points out the _inevitable_ result of certain actions. If we do X Y _will_ inescapably happen therefore we must reject X to avert Y. \n\nA slippery slope fallacy points out certain results of actions as if they are inevitable even though they aren\'t. Whether that result already happened as a consequence of that action still does not mean it was what was inevitably going to happen.\n\nIf I in the past said gay marriage would inevitably lead to gay parades I\'d have used a slippery slope fallacy to oppose gay marriage. Because it\'s perfectly possible to allow gay people to be accepted by society without allowing them to parade the streets half naked. That we _did_ allow them to parade doesn\'t mean my past fallacy is suddenly "correct". It still is and always would be a fallacy that incorrectly states that if gay marriage is allowed gay parades will _always_ follow therefore we should _never_ allow gay marriage. \n\nA slippery slope argument is not about whether your prophecy is correct it is about whether you\'re correct in stating that X is the _necessary and inevitable result_ of Y. If it\'s easy to do X without Y following there is no valid slippery slope argument to be made; it\'s a fallacy. If Y happens anyway for all kinds of reasons we could have averted but didn\'t that _still_ doesn\'t mean I would be correct in saying that if X then Y can\'t be averted.,0

Bring on the downvotes but ... \n\nITT: people misunderstanding what "taxation without representation" means.  \n\nEven if they\'re not allowed to vote yet teenagers still have representation.  They\'re still constituents of their state\'s elected representatives.  Congressmen are supposed to represent the interests of *everyone* in their state/district not just the ones who vote for them.  (Whether you think it always works out that way in practice is another question entirely.)   As a few people here have noted DC residents are among the few who might actually be able to use the "no taxation without representation" rallying cry legitimately because they have no voting representation in Congress.  They do get a few electoral votes at least.\n\nNow if you think teenagers should be able to vote or shouldn\'t have to pay taxes that\'s fine to argue but it\'s a separate issue from "taxation without representation".,6

> The verbiage "well regulated" refers to a legitimate militia being disciplined organized and beholden to the public at large. \n\nNo it doesn\'t. You\'re confusing state guards with a militia. There would be no reason to let "the people" keep and bear arms if the militia that they were a part of was run and therefore funded stocked trained and equipped by the government. Additionally one of the defining moments of the resistance was a British attempt to confiscate gunpowder and firearms from "the people". Makes zero sense for them to restrict guns when it was that very act that ignited the Revolution and that they won because the people kept and used their personal firearms.,1

"I like your line of thinking but I would argue you are defining power as being relative where I am defining it as an absolute measurement. Let's say general A commanded a military of 500 000 men but lost to his superiors who commanded a total of 2 million. Let's say general B commanded 80 000 but the country total was only 100 000. General A was clearly more powerful than General B in who he commanded and what he could do with that force but he lost to even more powerful total army of country A while general B already commanded the majority of the army of country B. \n\nHowever while General A may have lost his war would have cost the lives of hundreds of thousands minimum while General B only had the power to effect the lives of tens of thousands. General A in losing still effected more lives and had the power to end more people than general B.",3
Sorry for the late reply. Got kinda busy.\n\nOk you being a female explains much of your position. I can understand being attacked throughout your life by a certain group of people and then later watching the same people join your group would be annoying ( that oversimplifies it too much but I hope you don\'t mind). I don\'t agree with you ( identity politics is something I hate) but I can understand that there would be reasons for people to end up in that position.\n\nAs for the brain structure part it\'s not simple to explain all of it in a single reddit comment. Yes gay people do have similarities to female brains but it\'s different. Brain is an complex organ with different parts responsible for different things. So you can\'t just equate the two things. Also the case for trans people is difficult due to different categories of them. Anything I could fit in here to explain it would be completely wrong so I would not attempt to do that. But you would have to trust the science and accept that transgenderism is real. It isn\'t them watching porn and tv shows and realising they want to be female. It is much more than that. You could realise you are trans as early as 5 year old. Which leads to the next point.\n\n>Most children do outgrow gender dysphoria\n\nNo. Well maybe but that\'s very different. The article you linked is a personal case. It isn\'t very scientific.  The author in the article had a masculine gender expression growing which is very different from being trans. Authors case was due to them not adhering to conventional gender roles. Trans people are different. Even if you completely reversed every conventional girl boy thing ( girls like blue boys like pink girls like toys like cars and trucks boys like doll sets ) it won\'t matter to trans people. It would have definitely had an effect on author. This is also why I mentioned gender roles are bs. But even if you completely remove them trans people would still exist. So while children do outgrow gender dysphoria trans people don\'t.\n\n\nFirst I think you meant transgender females ( born male). Because I would be really surprised if transgender males are the ones committing sexual assault. And yeah that\'s a society problem that we have to fix. Most rapes are committed by males doesn\'t imply kill all men. It means educate all boys. Also trans people using transgenderism as a shield is identity politics which is wrong. All the same rules should apply to a trans female as they apply to a man or to a woman. Also you might know that law favours a woman so obviously it is a problem which already exists. What is your solution to that? \n\n\nI brought up Jordan Peterson because he is the one who is commonly mentioned when talking about free speech and using the wrong pronouns. And yeah the case of UK (and much of Europe) is fucked up because of their stupid free speech laws. But majority of their population seems to agree with it. Their common response in regards to hate speech is "why do you even want to say racist shit" which is not how things work as seen by using wrong pronouns being categorised as hate speech. Yeah the woke police there have figured out a way to call it hate speech but it is a result of having stupid laws. \n\nAs for entering spaces for women it\'s again a stupid problem. They shouldn\'t enter women restrooms but we should have non gendered restrooms too. Also we should teach young people why sexual assault is not cool so that maybe in the future a trans female can access a female restroom without other females being afraid of their lives. And trans male can enter a male restroom without getting harrassed. Sports I can understand because most trans females have obvious advantages but how about having sports based on skills instead of gender. It would also be beneficial to female players. So win-win?\n\nYeah agree until the part that law shouldn\'t compel you to respect people. But we have social pressure to do many things. You can chose to ignore all of it and follow cynicism but you wouldn\'t be as cool as Diogenes. You would probably be like that racist uncle. Everyone would probably hate you and you would deserve that (in exchange for your hate).,0

If I either: save heavily or get a second income from a spouse a house would be very achievable even on my modest earnings. If I was willing to be uncomfortable I could get land with a house right this second with just what I have. The thing is I don't want an hour+ commute to work. I don't want to have to haul water and propane. I don't want to have to have to snow plow my own road in the winter. And I most certainly don't want to have to uproot my life entirely and move somewhere affordable but then struggle to find work.\n\nWhich is the case for all of the current and last generation. Most absolutely could pull it off doubly so if they're willing to explore options to work the land like farming and ranching but it'd be **hard**. It wouldn't be a house down the road in the nice suburb they grew up in because housing prices doubled since they were born there.

There were people in that rally -- and I looked the night before -- if you look there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. Iâ€™m sure in that group there were some bad ones.

>demolition of churches\n\nThis is pretty much what destroyed the Second Republic and gave us the civil war and fascist regime that fucked up our economy for good. The left is sometimes too leftist.\n\n>Didn\'t realise the spanish general public is retarded. Fascism is by definition anti-capitalist and anti-communist.\n\nWell yes but no. Communism is by definition opposed to cults of personality and exploitation of the workers but look at the USSR... To be fair Franco was a national-syndicalist which are kind of fascists but also aren\'t and inside national-syndicalism he was a Francoist which is kind of lika a national-syndicalist... Except it totally isn\'t.\n\nFascism in general is an incoherent Frankenstein set of movements that originally had a set of ideals but that were purged by a certain sector of populists within the movement like Hitler or Franco who then managed to then take control of their countries. Francoism was basically a government of the rich over the poor the nobility over the working class (which was the actual material conflict that sparked the civil war Spain was undergoing the agrarian reform that happened in many other countries in the 1800s and since the nobiity was figuratively beheaded as the king was exiled they feared losing what remained of their power. Religion and politics were just a facade to mobilize the army). Our current class dynamics are still dominated by the heritage of the feudal system because our liberal revolutions weren\'t powerful enough to change our economy as it happened in the UK or France.\n\nBecause of these historical peculiarities the Spanish concept of fascism is "monarchist capitalism with anger issues".\n\nIn regars to where in Spain I\'m from I\'m going to tell you that I\'m pretty much surrounded by fascists (which is not relevant in a national scale because the Autonomous Community in which I live has a very sparse population). To the east I have a bunch of rabid Vasque nationalists with a fuckton of socialists (not socdems hardcore socialists) and anarchists as allies (the CNT is just a shell of its former self tbh) for some obscure reasons that I am yet to understand. In the West you can find Ancapistan after passing through Nowhere (Asturias). So yeah that\'s my close environment and where most people I interact with come from. I can also tell you that people in cities appear apolitical but are actually mostly moderates. They\'re not as noisy as the fascists.,6

"Those things aren't necessarily true.  Slavery only really existed to fund the cash crops in the south; the mere fact that the north could sustain itself economically during the Civil War without the southern slave based profits just shows how negligible an impact slavery really had in forming the nation.  If anything slavery held the south back by not allowing it to industrialize.  Again as I said last time nationalism isn't necessarily a blind following you can acknowledge the flaws of the past and work to better the future.  Those things you mentioned are not things to be proud of but as a whole I'm proud of my nation.  Don't get confused with that being pride in there government the government that has existed since around 1930 can go fuck right of personally nationalism is a pride in the people of the nation that worked to build it not the tyrannical 'law makers'.  \n\nFor me personally nationalism of more of a belief in the opposition of globalism.  Every nation and every people have a culture and a history nationalism is a way of preserving that history and that culture. Which is why I'm personally more nationalistic about Germany and Hungary those are the nations I heir from.",3

The communist countries have existed less than a century the death toll of pre 1900 genocides alone is probably higher than all communist genocides. Mind you this isn't a defense of tankies just you don't need to make stuff up.\n\nSecond one is wrong that number is the number of attempted suicides and we've no idea if it's universal. Also that's not insulting libleft if anything it further proves their point that transgender people are mistreated. \n\nThird one is false that was one survey that was flawed and has been misrepresented various studies have come up with all sorts of number ranging from below to above the average rate.\n\nFourth one might be close but we don't know since obviously the data isn't there. I'm sure the 1% are more likely to be child molesters than most.",6

Im not sure about the time scale on the predicted increase in power so i dont have the information to argue about wether we are seeing statstically significant increase in power already or that we haven reach that point where the different is statistically measurable yet. \n\nbut we have seen a decrease in the total number over the last few decades. But we are also in a downwards trend due to a cycle that we are nearing the bottom of and i think i remember that cycle being the main driver of that as of now.\n\nEdit: we have apparently at least not yet observed an increase of total energy output from Hurricanes. I think it was Bjorn Lomborg that put up that graph at the JRE? But total energy output not going up is not the same as not seeing stronger but fewer hurricanes. Because both weak and strong hurricanes add to the output and 0 "regular" hurricanes and 1 REALLY strong one over a decade will probably still be less total energy than multiple regular-semi strong ones will. So i think that point is a bit mis-leading,0

I generally agree that â€œpro-gunâ€ leftoids are an oxymoron especially in the US but a single Reddit comment chain is not indicative of any kind of proof outside of there being *some* people who agree with whatever strawman someone may construct.

"[Here's an actual article](https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/idaho-press/idaho-senator-unsuccessfully-tries-to-remove-rape-incest-abortion-exemptions/277-871e7800-09c3-4b35-8c13-8ddfae0bb81f).  Choice quotes:\n\n>Speaking on Martin Luther King Jr. Day/Idaho Human Rights Day Herndon equated his efforts to offer â€œequal protectionâ€ under the law to fetuses to Kingâ€™s civil rights efforts.\n\n>â€œItâ€™s kind of auspicious that today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day and he spent 13 years advancing the civil rights of people based on certain characteristics and this does the same thing â€ Herndon told the committee.\n\n>Minority Leader Sen. Melissa Wintrow D-Boise asked about situations in which teenage girls were raped by an uncle or father and if that girl would be forced to carry her pregnancy to term under Herndonâ€™s proposed legislation.\n\n>Herndon replied â€œsome people could describe the situation that youâ€™re talking about as the opportunity to have the child under those terrible circumstances if the rape actually occurred.â€\n\n>Currently the abortion ban includes an affirmative defense for abortions performed in cases of rape and incest if a police report is filed but Herndon said that is merely an allegation that a rape or incest took place.\n\nAnd\n\n>The legislation Herndon did successfully introduce relating to abortion would add definitions of abortion and embryo or fetus. The proposal would amend the stateâ€™s trigger ban to say that embryo or fetus would â€œmean any human in uteroâ€â€”which Herndon said would clarify that the criminal penalties for performing an abortion do not apply to treatment for an ectopic pregnancy which is when the fetus develops outside of the uterus.\n\n\n>The bill would add the definition â€œâ€˜Abortionâ€™ means the use or prescription of any instrument medicine drug or other substance or device to intentionally kill a living embryo or fetus. â€˜Abortionâ€™ shall not include the unintentional death of any human embryo or fetus.â€\n\n>He said adding that the embryo or fetus is â€œlivingâ€ and clarified that there would be no prosecution if an abortion was done when the fetus had miscarried.\n\n>The proposed bill adds that any person who provides care to a pregnant woman to save her life that results in the accidental death or injury to the fetus will not be prosecuted under the ban. Previously this only applied to healthcare professionals but Herndon said he wanted to expand it to include all first responders.\n\nSo his actually successful bill removes some of the malicious compliance ambiguities that were being abused to cause problems in other states.",1

I mean I understand where you\'re coming from but it is an entirely different ball-game. You could very well argue the reaction is overexaggerated but there is a history of this kind of sloganeering leading to a lot worse. I mean correct me if I\'m wrong but I\'m pretty sure those fliers were literally an operation by a bunch of 4channers to "radicalise normies" by causing this specific reaction. So it\'s like - you look for something inflammatory and you do the inflammatory thing and voila.\n\nThe reason why a slogan like - to borrow from a UK singer/rapper whose name I\'m forgetting - "black is beautiful" is considered different is because it\'s pushing against what\'s perceived to be the status quo. I feel like even you would have to admit the white equivalent sounds a bit blatant you know. Because we live in a very white society where nonwhite people have historically been treated poorly it\'s less of a "we\'re here goddammit!" and more of a "the current status quo is good".\n\nThis time I\'ll actually link the video. It\'s a response to a take about black nationalism and I think it explains why it\'s very different from white nationalism pretty well https://youtu.be/Q9a7nqz-CJ4,6

Many peoples are confused there. Allow me to clarify this reform.\n\nThe governement decided to raise the retirement age from 62-63 to 64. It may not seem much but it\'s a sipplery slope. We began the millenium with a retirement age of 60. Reform after reform they try to make people work longer and longer.\n\nThe thing is they do that to have more money to milk from old people so that older retired people can have a decent retirement rent.\n\nWhile this seem fair and it is the problem is that our deputies are overpaid and that the Macron governement systematically tried to lower the taxes on the rich people to raise more taxes on the working class hence why people feel like this reform is unfair (and it is). The money for retired peoples can be found somewhere else rather than destroying our worker\'s rights.\n\n"Muuuuh but in my country the retirement age is 67". Well congrats you\'re having a cucked country where Mr.Sugar Daddy Governement can make you work until you get sick of old age and everyone is ok with that ?

I donâ€™t think cow farts are the problem. You wanna go after emissions? Look into the emissions international shipping produces. The top 100 biggest cargo ships produce similar emissions to all cars on earth. Maybe if the â€œclimate activistâ€ left would stop stalling nuclear because apparently we have absolutely no method of storing the minuscule waste when we refuel the reactors every 20 years or so we canâ€™t do it. But electric cars and all the pollution from battery production is fine. ðŸ™„,1

"The other ones don't involve confiscation just preventing somebody from getting it in the first place. They'll happily prevent you from getting a gun in the first place. What are you going to do about it shoot them?\n\nOnce you have the gun it's the taking it away that cops have shown they're hesitant to do because they know their odds of receiving complimentary lead injections are substantially higher when doing that. Did you ever wonder why felons and violent criminals released on bail in places like Chicago still magically find themselves in possession of firearms with police never confiscating it until an arrest for some other crime has been made? It's because they're too scared to enforce the laws already on the books against someone who might shoot back.",1

The funny thing is rich white liberals still end up on top by being like â€œnot us weâ€™re a different kind of white you want those evil poor trump supporters from economically abandoned areasâ€. Itâ€™s like it doesnâ€™t matter that theyâ€™re the ones who maintain this system of â€œwhitenessâ€. Then they go on to use angry disadvantaged minorities as their attack dog against other more successful minority groups. The same thing happens in South Africa when they pit local South Africans against other African migrants.\n\nThe irony that the people who wonâ€™t stfu about racism are actually maintaining a increasingly radical system based in rigid racial/identity hierarchies that puts all the blame on poor white people while ignoring the people in power who or their ancestors had something to do with the current situation. Itâ€™s like that South Park episode where cartman measures everyoneâ€™s dick sizes and then when it comes to him he says he measured himself and has 9 inches despite having the smallest dick,2

My brother did the same thing when I visited for Christmas. He kept going on and on about Andrew Tate and how "he\'s a top G". I trolled him a bit and kept pretending like I\'ve never heard of the guy. It\'s just so ironic that the least productive member of my family is praising this guy because he owns Bugattis. He\'s young and stupid so I kinda get it. \n\nAnother part of me wishes he\'d internalize even a fraction of advice and apply himself to anything.

I support student loan forgiveness and subsidized education. Again long-term investment into society by the government.

>The only remaining segment of that way of life is our commmercial fisheries which are in the process of wiping out fish stocks.\n\nThis is a great example of why it\'s so dangerous to continue with the path we\'re on. In 200 years we may very well have depleted these entirely as with the megafauna. If that happens then the humans who come after that will have even fewer resources left because entire species of fish that would have been good food sources would then be extinct.\n\n> Hunting and gathering might support a billion humans but they\'ll be living off rats and grasshoppers and dying by the thousands whenever the rains fail\n\nWell sort of. First of all I think even 1 billion is probably more than the planet could/should sustain for a hunter gatherer lifestyle. But I see no problem with that I don\'t see any inherent value in having a bigger population. Especially when we\'ve seen that doing so exacerbates harm to the planet.\n\nI\'m not sure exactly what you\'re referring to by "whenever the rains fall" but in many ways a hunter gatherer lifestyle is more resilient to strange weather than an agricultural one. Hunter gatherers are able to go where the food is farmers aren\'t. One dry summer is all it takes to cause widespread famine in an agricultural society. Meanwhile if hunter gatherers noticed food becoming scarce they could simply go somewhere where there was more food.,8

Fair argument but one thing is off and itâ€™s a big one. \n\nYou say that you canâ€™t in good conscience regulate whether someone buys a firearm from statistics or regulate where someone goes in public spaces.  \n\nI agree with that because regardless of statistics weâ€™ve determined that all humans have those as birthrights. \n\nBecoming a parent is a right too that nobody should be able to infringe upon. However adopting a child is not covered in this right. If I and my gf decide to have a child this year whether we are good parents or not we cannot be stopped nor should we. But if we wanted to adopt a child this year we already have to go through very strict applications that dig into absolutely everything that could impact a childâ€™s outcome. We would not be able to adopt if we made under a certain amount. We would not be able to adopt if we lived in a risky lifestyle. We would not be able to adopt if we were not accepted by the adoptees or the organizations or the parents in some cases. \n\nTo sum my point up. Adoption is not a right and we already take â€œdiscriminatoryâ€ statistics into account in order to find matches for adoptees and adopters. You cannot adopt if youâ€™re poor you cannot adopt if you do even recreational drugs. You cannot adopt in some cases if you smoke. \n\nSaying that you also cannot adopt if youâ€™re more likely to commit a crime to the child is not a far stretch. \n\nMaybe we could come to an agreement that if you belong to a group more likely to commit a crime against a child you should have a more in depth screening into the adopters?,8

"Don't drag it out of context. When Donald Trump said that there were good people in both sides he clearly stated that some people who protested against the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue were good people because George Washington also had slaves and we can't take down every historical figure because of racism because all were racists and we'd have no statues left. But because some protesters were good according to Trump that doesn't mean that the Nazis there were also good. And it's very clear that Nazis don't like Trump that much. He was very pro-Israel and his daughter married a Jew. And even if the Mexican wall was ready and no illegal would enter the US whites would still fade away due to lower birth rates legal immigrants liberal ideology etc. Trump is not a Nazi. Nazis think he doesn't go far enough. Bernie Sanders is also not a communist because of some social policies.",2

Every faction supports the "guns for my group no guns for anyone else" philosophy.\n\nThe authlefts say so explicitly in that the party controls all firearms directly under close supervision with intense scrutiny of those carrying them.\n\nThe authrights claim to love the second amendment but voted for Ronnie who got shit banned because it was cheap enough for black folks to afford (because they dared carry rifles in public!).\n\nThe liblefts want gun control but only with the implicit assumption that their politicians will control the police and military who will remain armed.\n\nAnd the librights are even more gungho about the second amendment but are strangely silent when Castile or the like gets murdered by a cop in front of his toddler.\n\nMe? I support government subsidized machine guns for low income households with a 500 round monthly allotment to all members of of said household above the age of 8.\n\nMost social problems can be solved with higher rates of gun ownership. If you feel like gun owners would abuse you then you need to become a gun owner.,2

Arms have been defined as "Firearms" which is very specific. Nukes are not firearms. Do suicidal people not have the right to defend themselves with firearms? They do. You\'re going off on a tangent that makes no sense. No matter how much you argue once you start requiring "tests" to decide who owns guns you have given the government 100% control over who can and cannot own guns. When you do that we lose not only the right to a militia but the right to overthrow our oppressors. Good work.\n\n\nSorry for typos drinking vodka.,4
